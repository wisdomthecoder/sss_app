<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 They are gathering homeward from every land, <br/>
         One by one, one by one ; <br/>
         As their weary feet touch the shining strand,<br/>
         Yes, one by one. <br/>
         Their brows are enclosed in a golden crown,  <br/>
         Their travel-stained garments are all laid down ; <br/>
         And clothed in white raiment they rest in the mead, <br/>
         Where the Lamb doth love His saints to lead.
            
            <div class="chorus">
         Gathering home, gathering home, <br/>
         Fording the river, one by one ; <br/>
         Gathering home, gathering home, <br/>
         Yes, one by one. </div>

         2 We, too, shall come to the river side, <br/>
         One by one, one by one : <br/>
         We are nearer its waters each eventide, <br/>
         Yes, one by one. <br/>
         To some are the floods of the river stil , <br/>
         As they ford on their way to the heavenly hill ! <br/>
         To others the waves run fiercely and wild,  <br/>
         Yet they reach the home of the undefiled.<br/>
         <br/>
         3 Jesus, Redeemer, we look to Thee, <br/>
         One by one, one by one ; <br/>
         We lift lip our voices tremblingly, <br/>
         Yes, one by one. <br/>
         The waves of the river are dark and cold, <br/>
         But we know the place where our feet shall hold ;<br/>
         O Thou, who didst pass through in <br/>
         deepest midnight,  <br/>
         Now guide us, and send us the staff and light. <br/></p>
