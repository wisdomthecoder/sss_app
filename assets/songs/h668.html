<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Resting on the faithfulness of Christ our Lord,<br/>
         Resting on the fulness of His own sure word ; <br/>
         Resting on His wisdom, on His love and power,  <br/>
         Resting on His covenant from hour to hour.<br/>
         <br/>
         2 Resting 'neath His guiding hand for <br/>
         untracked days,<br/>
         Resting 'neath His shadow from the noontide rays; <br/>
         Resting at the eventide, beneath His wing,<br/>
         <br/>
         In the fair pavilion of our Saviour- King. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Resting in the fortress while the foe is nigh, <br/>
         Resting in the lifeboat while the waves roll high ;<br/>
         Resting in His chariot for the swift <br/>
         glad race,<br/>
         Resting, always resting, in His boundless grace. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Resting in the pastures, and beneath the Rock,<br/>
         Resting by the waters where He leads His flock ; <br/>
         Resting, while we listen at His <br/>
         glorious feet, [rest complete ! <br/>
         Resting in His arms of love----oh, <br/>
         <br/>
         5 Resting and believing, let us onward press, <br/>
         Resting on Himself,  the Lord our Righteousness !  <br/>
         Resting and rejoicing, let His saved ones sing---<br/>
         Glory, glory, glory be to Christ our King !  </p>
