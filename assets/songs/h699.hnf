
  1 O brother, life's journey beginning, 
         With courage and firmness arise !----
         Look well to the course thou art choosing; 
         Be earnest, be watchful, and wise ! 
         Remember----two paths are before thee, 
         And both thy attention invite ; 
         But one leadeth on to destruction, 
         The other to joy and delight.  
            
            Chorus
         God help you to follow His banner, 
         And serve Him wherever you go ; 
         And when you are tempted, my brother, 
         God give you the grace to say  No !  

         
         2 O brother, yield not to the tempter, 
         No matter what others may do ; 
         Stand firm in the strength of the Master, 
         Be loyal, be faithful, and true ! 
         Each trial will make you the stronger, 
         If you, in the name of the Lord, 
         Fight manfully under your Leader, 
         Obeying the voice of His word. 
         
         3 O brother, the Saviour is calling ! 
         Beware of the danger of sin ; 
         Resist not the voice of the Spirit, 
         That whispers so gently within. 
         God calls you to enter His service----
         To live for Him here, day by day ; 
         And share by and by in the glory 
         That never shall vanish away.
