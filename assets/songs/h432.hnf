  1 At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand of his lords, 
            While they drank from golden vessels, 
            as the Book of Truth records : 
            In the night, as they revelled in the 
            royal palace hall, 
            They were seized with consternation 
            -----'twas the Hand upon the wall ! 
            
            Chorus
            ‘Tis the hand of God on the wall ! . . . 
            'Tis the hand of God on the wall  . . . 
            Shall the record be---- Found wanting !  
            Or shall it be---- “Found trusting !  
            While that hand is writing on the wall ? . . . 

            2 See the brave captive, Daniel, as he 
            stood before the throng, 
            And rebuked the haughty monarch 
            for his mighty deeds of wrong ; 
            As he read out the writing-----'twas the 
            doom of one and all, 
            For the kingdom now was finished----
            said the Hand upon the wall ! 
            
            3 See the faith, zeal, and courage, that 
            would dare to do the right, 
            Which the Spirit gave to Daniel----
            'twas the secret of his might ; 
            In his home in Judea, or a captive in 
            the hall, [upon the wall ! 
            He understood the writing of his God 
            
            4 So our deeds are recorded-----there's a 
            Hand that's writing now : 
            Sinner, give your heart to Jesus---- to 
            His royal mandate bow ; 
            For the day is approaching â€” it must 
            come to one and all, 
            When the sinner's condemnation will 
            be written on the wall !
