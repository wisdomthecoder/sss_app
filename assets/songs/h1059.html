<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Sing to the Lord of harvest, <br/>
         Sing songs of love and praise ; <br/>
         With joyful hearts and voices <br/>
         Your hallelujahs raise: <br/>
         By Him the rolling seasons <br/>
         In fruitful order move, <br/>
         Sing to the Lord of harvest <br/>
         A song of happy love. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 By Him the clouds drop fatness, <br/>
         The deserts bloom and spring, <br/>
         The hills leap up in gladness, <br/>
         The valleys laugh and sing: <br/>
         He filleth with His fulness <br/>
         All things with large increase; <br/>
         He crowns the year with goodness, <br/>
         With plenty and with peace. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Heap on His sacred altar <br/>
         The gifts His goodness gave, <br/>
         The golden sheaves of harvest, <br/>
         The souls He died to save: <br/>
         Your hearts lay down before Him, <br/>
         When at His feet ye fall, <br/>
         And with your lives adore Him, <br/>
         Who gave His life for all. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 To God the gracious Father, <br/>
         Who made us  very good  ; <br/>
         To Christ, who, when we wandered, <br/>
         Restored us with His blood; <br/>
         And to the Holy Spirit, <br/>
         Who doth upon us pour <br/>
         His blessed dews and sunshine, <br/>
         Be praise for evermore. <br/></p>
