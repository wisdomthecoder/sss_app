  1 Take me, O my Father, take me ! 
            Take me, save me, through Thy Son ;  
            That which Thou wouldst have me, make me,
            Let Thy will in me be done, 
            Long from Thee my footsteps straying,
            Thorny proved the way I trod ; 
            Weary come I now, and praying, 
            Take me to Thy love, my God ! 
            
            2 Fruitless years with grief recalling, 
            Humbly I confess my sin ; 
            At Thy feet, O Father, falling, 
            To Thy household take me in. 
            Freely now to Thee I proffer 
            This repenting heart of mine ; 
            Freely life and soul I offer, 
            Gift unworthy love like Thine. 
            
            3 Once the world's Redeemer, dying, 
            Bare our sins upon the tree ; 
            On that Sacrifice relying, 
            Now I look in hope to Thee : 
            Father, take me ! all forgiving, 
            Fold me to Thy loving breast ; 
            In Thy love for ever living, 
            I must be for ever blest !
