
  1 Day by day the manna fell ;
    Oh to learn this lesson well !
    Still by constant mercy fed,
    Give us, Lord, our daily bread.
    
    2  Day by day, the promise reads,
    Daily strength for daily needs;
    Cast foreboding fear away,
    Take the manna of to-day.
    
    3 Thou our daily task shalt give;
    Day by day to Thee we live:
    So shall added years fulfil 
    Not our own, our Father's will.
