
  1 Did Christ o'er sinners weep ?
    And shall our tears be dry ?
    Let floods of penitential grief
    Burst forth from every eye.
    
    2 The Son of God in tears
    The wondering angels see :
    Be thou astonished, O my soul ?
    He shed those tears for thee.
    
    3 He wept that we might weep;
    Each sin demands a tear :
    In heaven alone no sin is found,
    And there's no weeping there
