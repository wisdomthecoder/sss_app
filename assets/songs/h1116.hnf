  Go on your way rejoicing, ye children of the King ; 
    In songs of holy rapture, His glorious triumph sing.

  Chorus
    Go on your way rejoicing, and to the world proclaim ! 
    Behold, Messiah bringeth redemption thro' His name.
  

  2 Go on your way rejoicing, to brave 
  the host of sin ; 
  From bondage and oppression immortal souls to win.
  
  3 Go on your way rejoicing ; the victory 
  draweth near ; 
  For He, your great Commander, in 
  clouds will soon appear.
