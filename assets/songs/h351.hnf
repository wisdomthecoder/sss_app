  Why do you wait, dear brother ? 
            Oh, why do you tarry so long ? 
            Your Saviour is waiting to give you 
            A place in His sanctified throng. 
            
            Chorus
            Why not ?----- Why not ?-----
            Why not come to Him now ? 
            

            2 What do you hope, dear brother, 
            To gain by a further delay ? 
            There's no one to save you but Jesus ; 
            There's no other way but His way. 
            
            3 Do you not feel, dear brother, 
            His Spirit now striving within ? 
            Oh, why not accept His salvation, 
            And throw off thy burden of sin ? 
            
            4 Why do you wait, dear brother ? 
            The harvest is passing away ; 
            Your Saviour is longing to bless you : 
            There's danger and death in delay.
