  1 Hark, my soul ! it is the Lord ; 
            'Tis thy Saviour, hear His word ; 
            Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee----
            Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou Me ?  
            
            2  I delivered thee when bound, 
            And, when bleeding, healed thy wound 
            Sought thee wandering, set thee right ; 
            Turned thy darkness into light. 
            
            3  Can a woman's tender care 
            Cease towards the child she bare ? 
            Yes ! she may forgetful be ; 
            Yet will I remember thee. 
            
            4  Mine is an unchanging love, 
            Higher than the heights above ; 
            Deeper than the depths beneath, 
            Free and faithful, strong as death. 
            
            5  Thou shalt see My glory soon, 
            When the work of grace is done ; 
            Partner of My throne shalt be ;------ 
            Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou Me ?‚Äù
            
            6 Lord, it is my chief complaint 
            That my love is weak and faint ; 
            Yet, I love Thee and adore ; 
            Oh for grace to love Thee more.
