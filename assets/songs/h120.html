  <p>1 Oh, what am I, that I should be<br/>
            The object of God's wondrous grace ?<br/>
            That He should send His Son to me,<br/>
            That I might see Him face to face ?

    <div class="chorus"> 
            It was for me, . . it was for me, . .<br/>
            For me He left His throne above;<br/>
            His grace, His goodness all for me, ..<br/>
            For me the ocean of His love.</div>
    
            2 That He should give His Son for me,<br/>
            A sacrifice of love Divine—<br/>
            Of love as boundless as the sea,<br/>
            That I might call the Saviour mine?<br/>
            <br/>
            3 Oh, wondrous love, that He should leave<br/>
            His throne, and come to earth for me !<br/>
            Should give His life my soul to save,<br/>
            The ransom pay that sets me free.<br/>
            <br/>
            4 A life of service, death of shame,<br/>
            Ensample true for all, for me—<br/>
            Oh, shall I not adore His name,<br/>
            Through time and through eternity.</p>
