<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 The blessed Redeemer has found me, <br/>
         And shattered the fetters that bound me; <br/>
         Though all was confusion around me, <br/>
         He came and spoke peace to my soul. <br/>
         In tenderest love He hath bought me, <br/>
         With patience He constantly sought me, <br/>
         The way of salvation He taught me, <br/>
         And made my heart perfectly whole.  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         He saves me, He saves me, <br/>
         His love fills my soul, hallelujah ! <br/>
         I'll praise Him, I'll praise Him, <br/>
         His Spirit abideth within. <br/>
         He saves me. He saves mej <br/>
         His love fills my soul, hallelujah ! <br/>
         I'll praise Him, I'll praise Him, <br/>
         His blood cleanseth me from all sin. </div>

         
         2 He sought me so long ere I knew Him, <br/>
         But finally winning me to Him, <br/>
         I yielded my all to pursue Him, <br/>
         And asked to be filled with His grace. <br/>
         Although a vile sinner before Him, <br/>
         Through faith I was led to implore Him, <br/>
         And now I rejoice and adore Him, <br/>
         Restored to His loving embrace. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 I never, no, never will leave Him, <br/>
         Grow weary of service and grieve Him, <br/>
         I'll constantly trust and believe Him, <br/>
         Secure in His presence divine. <br/>
         Abiding in love ever flowing,  <br/>
         In knowledge and grace ever growing, <br/>
         Confiding implicitly, knowing <br/>
         That Jesus the Saviour is mine. <br/></p>
