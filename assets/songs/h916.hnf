
  1 Only a few more years, 
         Only a few more cares ; 
         Only a few more smiles and tears, 
         Only a few more prayers, 
         
         2 Only a few more wrongs, 
         Only a few more sighs ; 
         Only a few more earthly songs, 
         Only a few good-byes. 
         
         3 Then an eternal stay ; 
         Then an eternal throng ; 
         hen an eternal, glorious day; 
         Then an eternal song !
