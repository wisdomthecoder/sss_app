  1 We will not despair, 
         Though storms our bark may sever ; 
         Knowing everywhere,
         Jehovah can deliver ! 
         
         2 When in death's dark vale, 
         By Jordan's rolling river, 
         Earthly helpers fail, 
         Jehovah must deliver ! 
         
         3 Oh, let come what will, 
         We'll trust our faithful Giver; 
         And our song is still----- 
         Jehovah will deliver !
