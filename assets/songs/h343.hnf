  1 There are angels hovering round, 
            
            2 To carry the tidings home, etc.
            
            3 To the new Jerusalem. 
            
            4 Poor sinners are coming home. 
            
            5 And Jesus bids them come. 
            
            6 And children too may come. 
            
            7 All heaven is full of joy. 
            
            8 For Jesus loves to save. 
            
            9 Come, children, trust Him now.
