<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 He leadeth His own with a gentle hand, <br/>
         A wonderful Saviour have we ! <br/>
         Oh, where is the friend that on earth we can find <br/>
         So full of compassion as He ? 
            
        <div class="chorus">
         Won - - - derful Saviour, won - - - derful Saviour <br/>
         Watching so tenderly o'er us ! <br/>
         Shedding bright sunshine before us ; <br/>
         Glo - - ry, hon - - our, and praise . . to His name ! </div>

         2 He leadeth His own with a gentle hand, <br/>
         Whenever we faint by the way ; <br/>
         How precious the blessings that fall from His throne, <br/>
         Like dew at the close of the day ! <br/>
         <br/>
         3 He leadeth His own with a gentle hand, <br/>
         And when we are sorrow-oppressed, <br/>
         He gathers us under the shade of His love, <br/>
         And there on His bosom we rest. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 He leadeth His own with a gentle hand, <br/>
         And oh, when our journey is o'er, <br/>
         What rapture in Eden to sit at His feet, <br/>
         And praise Him when time is no more !<br/></p>
