  1 We plough the fields, and scatter 
         The good seed on the land ; 
         But it is fed and watered 
         By God's almighty hand : 
         He sends the snow in winter, 
         The warmth to swell the grain ; 
         The breezes, and the sunshine, 
         And soft refreshing rain.  
            
        Chorus
         All good gifts around us 
         Are sent from heaven above : 
         Then thank the Lord, oh, thank the Lord, 
         For all His love ! 

         
         2 He only is the Maker 
         Of all things near and far : 
         He paints the wayside flower ; 
         He lights the evening star ; 
         The winds and waves obey Him ; 
         By Him the birds are fed ; 
         Much more to us, His children, 
         He gives our daily bread. 
         
         3 We thank Thee, then, O Father, 
         For all things bright and good : 
         The seed-time and the harvest, 
         Our life, our health, our food. 
         Accept the gifts we offer 
         For all Thy love imparts ; 
         And — what Thou most desirest — 
         Our humble, thankful hearts.
