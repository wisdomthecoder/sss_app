<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>I have a Saviour, He's pleading in glory,  <br/>
            A dear loving Saviour, though earth-friends be few ;<br/>
            And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me : <br/>
            And oh, that my Saviour were your Saviour too !
            
            <div class="chorus">
            For you I am praying, for you I am praying, <br/>
            For you I am praying, I'm praying for you. 
            </div>

            2 I have a Father : to me He has given <br/>
            A hope for eternity, blessed and true ; <br/>
            And soon He will call me to meet <br/>
            Him in heaven, [with me too ! <br/>
            But oh, may He lead you to go <br/>
            <br/>
            3 I have a robe: 'tis resplendent in whiteness,<br/>
            Awaiting in glory my wondering view ; <br/>
            Oh, when I receive it all shining in brightness, <br/>
            Dear friend, could I see you receiving one too !<br/>
            <br/>
            4 I have a peace : it is calm as a river----- <br/>
            A peace that the friends of this world never knew ; <br/>
            My Saviour alone is its Author and Giver, <br/>
            And oh, could I know it was given to you !<br/>
            <br/>
            5 When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,<br/>
            That my loving Saviour is your Saviour too ; <br/>
            Then pray that your Saviour may bring them to glory, <br/>
            And prayer will be answered, 'twas answered for you ! <br/></p>
