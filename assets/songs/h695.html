<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 The Son of God goes forth to war, <br/>
         A kingly crown to gain ; <br/>
         His blood-red banner streams afar, <br/>
         Who follows in His train ? <br/>
         Who best can drink His cup of woe, <br/>
         Triumphant over pain ; <br/>
         Who patient bears his cross below, <br/>
         He follows in His train. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 The martyr first, whose eagle eye <br/>
         Could pierce beyond the grave : <br/>
         Who saw his Master in the sky, <br/>
         And called on Him to save : <br/>
         Like Him, with pardon on his tongue, <br/>
         In midst of mortal pain,<br/>
         He prayed for them that did the wrong : <br/>
         Who follows in his train ? <br/>
         <br/>
         3 A glorious band, the chosen few, <br/>
         On whom the Spirit came:<br/>
         Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew, <br/>
         And mocked the cross and flame. <br/>
         They met the tyrant's brandished steel, <br/>
         The lion's gory mane ;<br/>
         They bowed their necks the death to feel : <br/>
         Who follows in their train ? <br/>
         <br/>
         4 A noble army----men and boys <br/>
         The matron and the maid---- <br/>
         Around the Saviour's throne rejoice, <br/>
         In robes of light arrayed,<br/>
         They climbed the steep ascent of heaven <br/>
         Through peril, toil, and pain : <br/>
         O God, to us may grace be given <br/>
         To follow in their train. <br/></p>
