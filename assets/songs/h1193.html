<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 The Saviour stands at thy door to-night, <br/>
         And is seeking thy heart to win ; <br/>
         The world for awhile has withdrawn its <br/>
         Wilt thou open and let Him in? [light : <br/>
         He has travelled afar on a lonely road, <br/>
         In sorrow and agony ; <br/>
         He has borne sin's heavy crushing load, <br/>
         All, all for the sake of thee ! 
            
            <div class="chorus">
         Let . . . Him in, . . . let . . . Him in ; . . . <br/>
         O - - pen the door . . and let . . Him come in. </div>

         2 He stands to plead with thee to-night, <br/>
         While the dews of the evening fall ; <br/>
         O'er the moaning and surging waves of life,<br/>
         Dost thou hear His yearning call <br/>
         He will free thy soul from the chains of earth, <br/>
         From its sorrow, its care, and sin; <br/>
         He will give thee joy for its hollow mirth : <br/>
         Wilt thou open and let Him in ? <br/>
         <br/>
         3 From the glorious heights of heaven He came, <br/>
         To seek thee and to save ; <br/>
         But the world it gave Him a cross of shame, <br/>
         And a lonely borrowed grave ;<br/>
         He left His radiant home above <br/>
         To bear thy load of sin ; <br/>
         He died to prove His deep, deep love: <br/>
         Wilt thou open and let Him in ? <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Thou hast wandered far in the paths of sin,<br/>
         Thou art weary, and sad, and lone; <br/>
         But His blood can cleanse, and His love <br/>
         can win : <br/>
         Wilt thou make Him now thine own ? <br/>
         The world has given thee care and pain, <br/>
         And mocked thee with its sin ;  <br/>
         He will give the treasures of priceless gain :<br/>
         Wilt thou open and let Him in ? <br/></p>
