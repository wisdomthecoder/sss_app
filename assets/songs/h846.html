<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 A long time I wandered in darkness and sin, <br/>
         And wondered if ever the light would shine in ; <br/>
         I heard Christian friends speak of raptures divine, <br/>
         And I wished — how I wished — that <br/>
         their Saviour were mine. <br/>
         I wished He were mine, yes, I wished He were mine ;  <br/>
         I wished — how I wished — that their Saviour were mine.<br/>
         <br/>
         2 I heard the glad gospel of  good-will to men  ; <br/>
         I read  whosoever  again and again ;<br/>
         I said to my soul,  Can that promise be thine ?  <br/>
         And then began hoping that Jesus was mine.<br/>
         I hoped He was mine, yes, I hoped He was mine; <br/>
         And then began hoping that Jesus was mine. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Oh, mercy surprising ! He saves even me! <br/>
         Thy portion for ever, He says,will I be;  <br/>
         On His word I am resting — assurance divine :  <br/>
         I am  hoping  no longer ; I know He is mine.<br/>
         I know He is mine, yes, I know He is mine ; <br/>
         I'm hoping no longer, I know He is mine. <br/></p>
