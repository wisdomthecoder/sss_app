  <p>1 By and by we shall know Jesus, <br/>
         By and by, oh, by and by ; <br/>
         Even now He looks and sees us, <br/>
         Journeying toward His Home on <br/>
         And He smiles upon us, saying, [high, <br/>
         By and by, oh, by and by, <br/>
         Cares and trials you'll be laying <br/>
         With your earthly garments by.*'  
            
        <div class="chorus">
         Oh,  By and by, we sing it softly, <br/>
         Thinking not of earthly care, <br/>
         But the  by and by  of heaven <br/>
         Waiting for us over there. </div>

         
         2 By and by we shall be standing, <br/>
         By and by, oh, by and by, <br/>
         At fair heaven's shining landing, <br/>
         While the river murmurs by ; <br/>
         And our friends will round us gather, <br/>
         By and by, oh, by and by, <br/>
         Saying,  Welcome, for the Father <br/>
         Loves to have His children nigh. <br/>
         <br/>
         3  By and by !  we say it gently, <br/>
         Looking on our peaceful dead, <br/>
         And we do not think of earth-life, <br/>
         But of heaven's sweet life instead. <br/>
         By and by we all shall gather, <br/>
         By and by, oh, by and by, <br/>
         In the love of God our Father, <br/>
         That shall know no  by and by. <br/></p>
