
  1 Come, Holy Ghost, in love, 
            Shed on us from above 
            Thine own bright ray : 
            Divinely good Thou art ; 
            Thy sacred gifts impart 
            To gladden each sad heart : 
            Oh, come to-day ! 
            
            2 Come, tenderest Friend and best, 
            Our most delightful Guest, 
            With soothing power : 
            Rest, which the weary know ; 
            Shade, 'mid the noontide glow; 
            Peace, when deep griefs o'erflow : 
            Cheer us this hour. 
            
            3 Come, Light serene and still, 
            Our inmost bosoms fill ; 
            
            Dwell in each breast ! 
            We know no dawn but Thine ; 
            Send forth Thy beams divine. 
            On our dark souls to shine, 
            And make us blest. 
            
            4 Exalt our low desires, 
            Extinguish passion's fires, 
            Heal every wound ; 
            Our stubborn spirits bend, 
            Our icy coldness end, 
            Our devious steps attend 
            While heavenward bound. 
            
            5 Come, all the faithful bless : 
            Let all who Christ confess 
            His praise employ ; 
            Give virtue's rich reward ; 
            Victorious death accord, 
            And, with our glorious Lord, 
            Eternal joy.
