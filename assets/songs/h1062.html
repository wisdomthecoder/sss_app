  <p>1 Great Ruler of the land and sea, <br/>
         Almighty God, we come to Thee ; <br/>
         Able to succour and to save <br/>
         From perils of the wind and wave. <br/>
         Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep <br/>
         The dwellers on the homeless deep ! <br/>
         <br/>
         2 Speak to the shadows of the night, <br/>
         And turn their darkness into light; <br/>
         Smooth down the breakers rising crest, <br/>
         Say to the billow,  Be at rest !  <br/>
         Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep <br/>
         The dwellers on the homeless deep !<br/>
         <br/>
         3 Soothe the rough ocean's troubled face, <br/>
         And bid the hurricane give place <br/>
         To the soft breeze that wafts the bark <br/>
         Safely alike through light and dark. <br/>
         Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep <br/>
         The dwellers on the homeless deep I <br/>
         <br/>
         4 In storm or battle, with Thine arm <br/>
         Shield Thou the mariner from harmâ€” <br/>
         From foes without, from ills within, <br/>
         From deeds, and words, and thoughts, of sin. <br/>
         Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep <br/>
         The dwellers on the homeless deep ! <br/>
         <br/>
         5 O Son of God, in days of ill, <br/>
         Say to each sorrow, ' Peace ! be still !<br/>
         In hours of weakness be Thou nigh, <br/>
         Heal Thou the sickness, hear the cry. <br/>
         Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep <br/>
         The dwellers on the homeless deep I <br/>
         <br/>
         6 When hidden is each guiding-star, <br/>
         Flash out the beacon's light afar; <br/>
         From mist and rock, and shoal and spray<br/>
         Protect the sailor on his way., <br/>
         Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep <br/>
         The dwellers on the homeless deep ! <br/>
         <br/>
         7 Defend from the quick lightning's stroke, <br/>
         And from the iceberg's crushing shock ;<br/>
         Take Thou the helm, and surely guide <br/>
         The wanderer o'er the wayward tide. <br/>
         Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep <br/>
         The dwellers on the homeless deep ! <br/>
         <br/>
         8 Good Pilot of the awful main, <br/>
         Let us not plead Thy love in vain; <br/>
         Jesus, draw near with kindly aid, <br/>
         Say,  It is I ; be not afraid !  <br/>
         Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep <br/>
         The dwellers on the homeless deep !<br/></p>
