  1 Must I go-----and empty-handed ?  
         Thus my dear Redeemer meet ? 
         Not one day of service give Him, 
         Lay no trophy at His feet?  
            
            Chorus
         Must I go-----and empty-handed ?  
         Must I meet my Saviour so ? 
         Not one soul with which to greet Him ? 
         Must I empty-handed go ? 

         
         2 Not at death I shrink or falter, 
         For my Saviour saves me now ; 
         But to meet Him empty-handed, 
         Thought of that now clouds my brow. 
         
         3 Oh, the years of sinning wasted, 
         Could I but recall them now, 
         I would give them to my Saviour, 
         To His wilt I'd gladly bow. 
         
         4 Up, ye saints, arouse, be earnest ! 
         Up and work while yet 'tis day ; 
         Ere the night of death o'ertake you, 
         Strive for souls while yet you may.
