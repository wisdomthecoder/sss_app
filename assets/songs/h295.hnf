  1 The Lord bless thee, and keep thee : 
            The Lord make His face shine upon thee,
            And be gracious unto thee, 
            And be gracious unto thee : 
            The Lord lift up His countenance, 
            His countenance upon thee, 
            And give thee peace. . . .
