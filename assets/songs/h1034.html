<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Grand is the song of the Easter morn, <br/>
         Victory is won ! victory is won ! <br/>
         Far o'er the hills with the light 'tis <br/>
         borne, <br/>
         Victory is won through Christ ! <br/>
         Chasing the shades of night away, <br/>
         Bringing the light of glorious day, <br/>
         Taking from Death his strength and sway, <br/>
         Victory is won through Christ  <br/>
         <br/>
         2 Grand was the scene when the stone was rolled, <br/>
         Off from the sepulchre dark and cold : <br/>
         Angels alone could view that sight ; <br/>
         Man could not bear that vision bright ; <br/>
         Forth came the Conqueror armed with might, <br/>
         Victory is won through Christ ! <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Grand was the word that the women brought, <br/>
         Mingled with wonders, with glories fraught :<br/>
         Seek not the living, the angels said, <br/>
         Seek not the living among the dead  ; <br/>
         Sorrow is past and night is fled, <br/>
         Victory is won through Christ ! <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Grand is this truth, O saints, for you, <br/>
         Yours is the joy and the blessing too, <br/>
         Since Jesus took from Death bis key, <br/>
         He from the tomb will set us free ; <br/>
         And through all time and eternity, <br/>
         Victory is won through Christ ! <br/></p>
