<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 We're soldiers of the King, <br />
    Redeemed and saved by blood, <br />
    And now enlisted for the war <br />
    To fight for Christ the Lord. <br />
    In peril oft are we, <br />
    But joyfully we sing, <br />
    Our hearts made strong by Him who leads<br />
    The soldiers of the King.


  <div class="chorus">
    We're soldiers of the King, . . His praises we <br />
    will sing,, . .<br />
    And we will serve Him loyally, our great and glorious King.
  </div>


  2 We're soldiers of the King, <br />
  His Name we gladly bear,<br />
  The Name once nailed above the Cross, <br />
  When Christ our King was there. <br />
  We'll count our losses gain, <br />
  And welcome every sting, <br />
  To honour our Lord Jesus' name, <br />
  As soldiers of the King. <br />
  <br />
  3 We're soldiers of the King, <br />
  With Him we shall appear, <br />
  If we with Him shall suffer now, <br />
  And His rejection share. <br />
  Then lift His banner high, <br />
  For time is on the wing, <br />
  The crowning day is hastening on <br />
  For soldiers of the King.</p>
