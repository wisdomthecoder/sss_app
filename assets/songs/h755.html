  <p>1 Have ye heard the song from the golden land ? <br/>
         Have ye heard the glad new song? <br/>
         Let us bind our sheaves with a willing hand,<br/>
         For the time will not be long,  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         The Lord of the harvest will soon appear, <br/>
         His smile, His voice we shall see and hear! <br/>
         The Lord of the harvest will soon appear, <br/>
         And gather the reapers home ! </div>

         
         2 They are looking down from the golden land, <br/>
         Our beloved are looking down; <br/>
         They have done their work, they have <br/>
         borne their cross, <br/>
         And received their promised crown. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Oh, the song rolls on from the golden land, <br/>
         And our hearts are strong to-day. <br/>
         For it nerves our souls with its music sweet, <br/>
         As we toil in the noontide ray. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Oh, the song rolls on from the golden land, <br/>
         From its vales of joy and flowers ; <br/>
         And we feel and know by a living faith <br/>
         That its tones will soon be ours. <br/></p>
