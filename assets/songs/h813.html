<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Hark the voice of Jesus crying — <br/>
         Who will go and work to-day ? <br/>
         Fields are white, and harvest waiting : <br/>
         Who will bear the sheaves away ?  <br/>
         Loud and strong the Master calleth, <br/>
         Rich reward He offers thee : <br/>
         Who will answer, gladly saying ? — <br/>
         Here am I ; send me, send me !  <br/>
         <br/>
         2 If you cannot cross the ocean, <br/>
         And the heathen lands explore, <br/>
         You can find the heathen nearer, <br/>
         You can help them at your door. <br/>
         If you cannot give your thousands, <br/>
         You can give the widow's mite ; <br/>
         And the least you do for Jesus <br/>
         Will be precious in His sight. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 If you cannot speak like angels, <br/>
         If you cannot preach like Paul, <br/>
         You can tell the love of Jesus, <br/>
         You can say He died for all. <br/>
         If you cannot rouse the wicked <br/>
         With the Judgment's dread alarms, <br/>
         You can lead the little children <br/>
         To the Saviour's waiting arms. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 If you cannot be the watchman, <br/>
         Standing high on Zion's wall, <br/>
         Pointing out the path to heaven, <br/>
         Offering life and peace to all ;  <br/>
         With your prayers and with your bounties <br/>
         You can do what Heaven demands ; <br/>
         You can be like faithful Aaron, <br/>
         Holding up the prophet's hands. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 If among the older people <br/>
         You may not be apt to teach : <br/>
         Feed My lambs, said Christ our <br/>
         Shepherd, <br/>
         Place the food within their reach.<br/>
         And it may be that the children <br/>
         You have led with trembling hand <br/>
         Will be found among your jewels, <br/>
         When you reach the better land. <br/>
         <br/>
         6 Let none hear you idly saying, <br/>
         There is nothing I can do, <br/>
         While the souls of men are dying, <br/>
         And the Master calls for you. <br/>
         Take the task He gives you gladly, <br/>
         Let His work your pleasure be ; <br/>
         Answer quickly when He calleth : <br/>
         Here am I ; send me, send me !  <br/></p>
