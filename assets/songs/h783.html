<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 AThe walls of Jericho were strong ; <br/>
         But stronger was the mighty Lord : <br/>
         And He -----the Captain of God's host----<br/>
         Had given them His faithful word :----- <br/>
         That if they would the walls surround,<br/>
         And would the trumpets blow; <br/>
         He then would give them victory, <br/>
         And overthrow their foe.<br/>
         <br/>
         2 The gates of Jericho were strong--- <br/>
         They could not any stronger be : <br/>
         But there was One who them defied----<br/>
         And with the host of God was He. <br/>
         No work for Him would be too great, <br/>
         Too hard to undertake ; <br/>
         For He could burst the gates of brass <br/>
         The bars of iron break. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 And we, O Lord, are waging war <br/>
         Against the mighty hosts of sin : <br/>
         And neither skill nor strength have we, <br/>
         So oft have we defeated been. <br/>
         But if Thou wilt our Captain be, <br/>
         Our weakened ranks command, <br/>
         Then led by Thee we'll face the foe. <br/>
         His fierce assaults withstand. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Strong Son of God ! we need more faith <br/>
         In Thine almighty power to save : <br/>
         Oh ! hear the prayer of contrite hearts <br/>
         As we Thy keeping grace would crave ; <br/>
         Help us to trust in Thee alone, <br/>
         To save us every day ; <br/>
         Oh ! make us, in the rest of faith, <br/>
         Triumphant all the way. <br/> </p>
