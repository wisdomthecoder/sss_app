<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Not saved are we by trying, <br/>
            From self can come no aid ; <br/>
            'Tis on the Blood relying, <br/>
            Once for our ransom paid. <br/>
            Come to the Saviour now ! <br/>
            He gently calleth thee ; <br/>
            In true repentance bow, <br/>
            Before Him bend the knee ! <br/>
            He waiteth to bestow <br/>
            Salvation, peace, and love, <br/>
            True joy on earth below, <br/>
            A home in heaven above. <br/>
            Come, come, come. <br/>
            <br/>
            2 Come to the Saviour now ! <br/>
            Gaze on that cleansing tide--- <br/>
            Water and blood that flow <br/>
            Forth from His wounded side. <br/>
            Hark to the suffering One : <br/>
            'Tis finished !  now He cries ; <br/>
            Redemption's work is done, <br/>
            Then bows His head and dies. <br/>
            Come, come, come. <br/>
            <br/>
            3 Come to the Saviour now ! <br/>
            He suffered all for thee ; <br/>
            And in His merits thou <br/>
            Hast an unfailing plea : <br/>
            No vain excuses frame, <br/>
            For feelings do not stay ; <br/>
            None who to Jesus came <br/>
            Were ever sent away. <br/>
            Come, come, come. <br/>
            <br/>
            4 Come to the Saviour now ! <br/>
            Ye who have wandered far, <br/>
            Renew your solemn vow, <br/>
            For His by right you are. <br/>
            Come, like poor wandering sheep <br/>
            Returning to His fold---- <br/>
            His arm will safely keep, <br/>
            His love will ne'er grow cold. <br/>
            Come, come, come.<br/>
            <br/>
            5 Come to the Saviour, all ! <br/>
            Whate'er your burdens be ; <br/>
            Hear now His loving call----- <br/>
            Cast all your care on Me. <br/>
            Come, and for every grief <br/>
            In Jesus you will find <br/>
            A sure and safe relief, <br/>
            A loving Friend and kind. <br/>
            Come, come, come. <br/></p>
