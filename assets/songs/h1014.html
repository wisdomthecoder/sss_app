<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 I saw a way-worn traveller, <br/>
         In tattered garments clad, <br/>
         And struggling up the mountain, <br/>
         It seemed that he was sad ; <br/>
         His back was laden heavy, <br/>
         His strength was almost gone, <br/>
         Yet he shouted as he journeyed, <br/>
         Deliverance will come ! <br/>
         Then palms of victory, crowns of glory <br/>
         Palms of victory I shall bear. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 The summer sun was shining, <br/>
         The sweat was on his brow, <br/>
         His garments worn and dusty, <br/>
         His step seemed very slow ; <br/>
         But he kept pressing onward, <br/>
         For he was wending home, <br/>
         Still shouting as he journeyed, <br/>
         Deliverance will come !  <br/>
         <br/>
         3 The songsters in the arbour <br/>
         That stood beside the way <br/>
         Attracted his attention, <br/>
         Inviting his delay : <br/>
         His watchword being  Onward !  <br/>
         He stopped his ears and ran, <br/>
         Still shouting as he journeyed, <br/>
         Deliverance will come ! '* <br/>
         <br/>
         4 I saw him in the evening ; <br/>
         The sun was bending low ; <br/>
         He'd overtopped the mountain, <br/>
         And reached the vale below : <br/>
         He saw the Golden City — <br/>
         His everlasting home, — <br/>
         And shouted loud,  Hosanna ! <br/>
         Deliverance will come !  <br/>
         <br/>
         5 While gazing on that City, <br/>
         Just o'er the narrow flood, <br/>
         A band of holy angels <br/>
         Came from the throne of God ; <br/>
         They bore him on their pinions <br/>
         Safe o'er the dashing foam, <br/>
         And joined him in his triumph : <br/>
         Deliverance had come ! <br/>
         <br/>
         6 I heard the song of triumph <br/>
         They sang upon that shore, <br/>
         Saying,  Jesus has redeemed us <br/>
         To suffer nevermore !  <br/>
         Then, casting his eyes backward <br/>
         On the race which he had run, <br/>
         He shouted loud,  Hosanna ! <br/>
         Deliverance has come !  <br/>
         <br/></p>
