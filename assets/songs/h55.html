  <p>1 She only touched the hem of His garment<br/>
    As to His side she stole, <br/>
    Amid the crowd that gathered around Him; <br/>
    And straightway she was whole.
    
    <div class="chorus">
    Oh, touch the hem of His garment ! <br/>
    And thou, too, shalt be free ; <br/>
    His saving power this very hour <br/>
    Shall give new life to thee ! </div>

    2 She came in fear and trembling <br/>
    before Him, <br/>
    She knew her Lord had come ; <br/>
    She felt that from Him virtue had <br/>
    healed her ; <br/>
    The mighty deed was done. <br/>
    <br/>
    3 He turned with  Daughter, be of good comfort, <br/>
    Thy faith hath made thee whole !  <br/>
    And peace that passeth all under-standing <br/>
    With gladness filled her soul. <br/></p>
