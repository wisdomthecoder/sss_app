<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 I was wandering, sad, and weary, <br/>
            When the Saviour came unto me ; <br/>
            For the paths of sin were dreary, <br/>
            And the world had ceased to woo me : <br/>
            And I thought I heard Him say, <br/>
            As He came along His way : 
            
            <div class="chorus">
            Wandering souls, O do come near Me ; <br/>
            My sheep should never fear Me :<br/>
            I am the Shepherd true, I am the Shepherd true !  </div>

            2 At first I would not hearken, <br/>
            But put off till the morrow, <br/>
            Till life began to darken, <br/>
            And I grew sick with sorrow : <br/>
            Then I thought I heard Him say, <br/>
            As He came along His way : <br/>
            <br/>
            3 At last I stopped to listen----<br/>
            His voice could ne'er deceive me----<br/>
            I saw His kind eye glisten, <br/>
            So anxious to relieve me : <br/>
            Then I knew I heard Him say, <br/>
            As He came along His way : <br/>
            <br/>
            4 I thought His love would weaken <br/>
            As more and more He knew me, <br/>
            But it burneth like a beacon, [me ; <br/>
            And its light and heat go through <br/>
            And I ever hear Him say, <br/>
            As He goes along His way : <br/></p>
