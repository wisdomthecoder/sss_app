
  1 There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,
         There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes, 
         There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes 
         To gather His loved ones home. 
            
            Chorus
         To gather His loved ones home, . . 
         To gather His loved ones home ; . . 
         There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes 
         To gather His loved ones home.

         
         2 There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes, 
         There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes ;
         But a glorious morrow when Jesus comes 
         To gather His loved ones home. 
         
         3 There'll be no more weeping when Jesus comes, 
         There'll be no more weeping when Jesus comes ;
         But a blessed reaping when Jesus comes 
         To gather His loved ones home. 
         
         4 There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
         There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes ;  
         And a joyful meeting when Jesus comes 
         To gather His loved ones home.
