<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Once in royal David's city<br/>
    Stood a lowly cattle shed,<br/>
    Where a mother laid her Baby,<br/>
    In a manger for His bed.<br/>
    Mary was that mother mild,<br/>
    Jesus Christ her little Child.<br/>
    <br/>
    2 He came down to earth from heaven,<br/>
    Who is God and Lord of all,<br/>
    And His shelter was a stable,<br/>
    And His cradle was a stall.<br/>
    With the poor, and mean, and lowly,<br/>
    Lived on earth our Saviour holy.<br/><br/>
    <br/>
    3 And through all His wondrous child-<br/>
    He would honour and obey, [hood<br/>
    Love and watch the lowly mother<br/>
    In whose gentle arms He lay.<br/>
    Christian children all must be<br/>
    Mild,obedient, good as He.<br/>
    <br/>
    4 For He is our childhood's pattern,<br/>
    Day by day like us He grew ;<br/>
    He was little, weak, and helpless,<br/>
    Tears and smiles like us He knew ;<br/>
    And He feeleth for our sadness,<br/>
    And He shareth in our gladness.<br/>
    <br/>
    5 And our eyes at last shall see Hirn<br/>
    Through His own redeeming love,<br/>
    For that Child so dear and gentle<br/>
    Is our Lord in heaven above ;<br/>
    And He leads His children on<br/>
    To the place where He is gone.<br/>
    <br/>
    6 Not in that poor lowly stable,<br/>
    With the oxen standing by,<br/>
    We shall see Him-- but in heaven,<br/>
    Set at God's right hand on high;<br/>
    When like stars His children crowned,<br/>
    All in white shall wait around.<br/></p>
