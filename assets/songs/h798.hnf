
  1 Fading away like the stars of the morning,
         Losing their light in the glorious sun---- 
         Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
         Only remembered by what we have done.  
            
            Chorus
         Only remembered, only remembered, 
         Only remembered by what we have done ; 
         Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling, 
         Only remembered by what we have done. 

         
         2 Shall we be missed, though by others 
         succeeded, [time have sown ? 
         Reaping the fields we in spring- 
         Yes, but the sowers must pass from their labours,
         Ever remembered by what they have done. 
         
         3 Only the truth that in life we have spoken,
         Only the seed that on earth we have sown ; 
         These shall pass onward when we are forgotten, 
         Fruits of the harvest and what we have done. 
         
         4 Oh, when the Saviour shall make up His jewels,
         When the bright crowns of rejoicing are won, 
         Then shall His weary and faithful disciples 
         All be remembered by what they have done.
