  <p>There are lonely hearts to cherish, <br/>
         While the days are going by ; <br/>
         There are weary souls who perish, <br/>
         While the days are going by : <br/>
         If a smile we can renew, <br/>
         As our journey we pursue, <br/>
         Oh, the good we all may do, <br/>
         While the days are going by !  
            
        <div class="chorus">
         Going by ! . . . Going by ! . . . <br/>
         Going by ! . . . Going by ! . . . <br/>
         Oh, the good we all may do, <br/>
         While the days are going by ! </div>

         
         2 There's no time for idle scorning, <br/>
         While the days are going by ; <br/>
         Let your face be like the morning, <br/>
         While the days are going by: <br/>
         Oh, the world is full of sighs, <br/>
         Full of sad and weeping eyes ; <br/>
         Help your fallen brother rise, <br/>
         While the days are going by I <br/>
         <br/>
         3 All the loving links that bind us, <br/>
         While the days are going by ; <br/>
         One by one, we leave behind us, <br/>
         While the days are going by : <br/>
         But the seeds of good we sow, <br/>
         Both in shade and shine will grow, <br/>
         And will keep our hearts aglow, <br/>
         While the days are going by ! <br/></p>
