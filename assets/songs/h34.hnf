  1 To us a Child of hope is born,
    To us a Son is given;
    Him shall the tribes of earth obey,
    Him all the hosts of heaven.
    
    2 His name shall be the Prince of Peace,
    For evermore adored,
    The Wonderful, the Counsellor,
    The great and mighty Lord !
    
    3 His power, increasing, still shall spread;
    His reign no end shall know:
    Justice shall guard His throne above,
    And peace abound below.
