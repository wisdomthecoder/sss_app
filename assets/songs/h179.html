<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 In the crimson blush of morning <br/>
            In the glitter of the noon, <br/>
            In the midnight's gloomy darkness, <br/>
            Or the gleaming of the moon. <br/>
            In the stillness of the twilight, <br/>
            As it shimmers in the sky, <br/>
            We are watching, we are waiting, <br/>
            For the end that draweth nigh. <br/>
            <br/>
            2 We shall see our Lord in splendour, <br/>
            And amid a countless throng, <br/>
            On the clouds to earth descending, <br/>
            With a movement swift and strong ; <br/>
            And the angels round about Him, <br/>
            In their dazzling white array, <br/>
            While before Him sounds the summons <br/>
            For the final Judgment-day. <br/>
            <br/>
            3 He will welcome all His people, <br/>
            He will diadem His own ; <br/>
            He will show to them His glory, <br/>
            And will share with them His throne ; <br/>
            And for ever in His presence <br/>
            They shall see Him face to face, <br/>
            While they chant His matchless <br/>
            wisdom, <br/>
            And extol His wondrous grace. <br/>
            <br/>
            4 He is coming, surely coming, <br/>
            For His promise cannot fail ; <br/>
            And the scoffers shall behold Him ? <br/>
            And before Him they shall quail !<br/>
            He is coming, quickly coming ! <br/>
            But His coming we shall greet ; <br/>
            We have waited for His advent, <br/>
            And have listened for His feet. <br/></p>
