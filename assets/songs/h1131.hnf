  1 Tell me the Old, Old Story 
         Of unseen things above, 
         Of Jesus and His glory, 
         Of Jesus and His love. 
         Tell me the Story simply, 
         As to a little child, 
         For I am weak and weary, 
         And helpless and defiled 
         Tell me the Old, Old Story 
         Of Jesus and His love. 
         
         2 Tell me the Story slowly, 
         That I may take it in â€” 
         That wonderful redemption, 
         God's remedy for sin. 
         Tell me the Story often, 
         For I forget so soon ; 
         The  early dew  of morning 
         Has passed away at noon. 
         
         3 Tell me the Story softly, 
         With earnest tones and grave ; 
         Remember ! I'm the sinner 
         Whom Jesus came to save. 
         Tell me that Story always, 
         If you would really be, 
         In any time of trouble, 
         A comforter to me. 
         
         4 Tell me the same Old Story, 
         When you have cause to fear 
         That this world's empty glory 
         Is costing me too dear. 
         Yes, and when that world's glory 
         Is dawning on my soul, 
         Tell me the Old, Old Story : 
         Christ Jesus makes thee whole.
