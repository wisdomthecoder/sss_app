<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 If I were a voice, a persuasive voice, <br/>
         That could travel the wide world through, <br/>
         I would fly on the beams of the morning light, <br/>
         And speak to men with a gentle might, <br/>
         And tell them to be true. 
            
            <div class="chorus">
         I would fly, I would fly over land and sea,<br/>
         Wherever a human heart might be, <br/>
         Telling a tale, or singing a song, <br/>
         In praise of the right and in blame of the wrong:<br/>
         I would fly, I would fly, <br/>
         I would fly over land and sea. </div>

         2 If I were a voice, a consoling voice, <br/>
         I would fly on the wings of the air ; <br/>
         The homes of sorrow and guilt I'd seek, <br/>
         And calm and truthful words I'd speak, <br/>
         To save them from despair. [town, <br/>
         I would fly, I would fly o'er the crowded <br/>
         And drop like the happy sunlight down <br/>
         Into the hearts of suffering men, <br/>
         And teach them to look up again : <br/>
         I would fly, I would fly, <br/>
         I would fly o'er the crowded town. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 If I were a voice, a convincing voice, <br/>
         I would travel with the wind, <br/>
         And wherever I saw the nations torn <br/>
         By warfare, jealousy, spite or scorn, <br/>
         Or hatred of their kind, <br/>
         <br/>
         I would fly, I would fly on the thunder-crash,  <br/>
         And into their blinded bosoms flash : <br/>
         Then with their evil thoughts subdued, <br/>
         I'd teach them Christian brotherhood : <br/>
         I would fly, I would fly, <br/>
         I would fly on the thunder-crash. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 If I were a voice, an immortal voice, <br/>
         I would fly the earth around ; <br/>
         And wherever man to his idols bowed, <br/>
         I'd publish in notes both long and loud <br/>
         The Gospel's joyful sound. <br/>
         I would fly, I would fly on the wings of day,  <br/>
         <br/>
         Proclaiming peace on my world-wide way,<br/>
         Bidding the saddened earth rejoice â€” <br/>
         If I were a voice, an immortal voice, <br/>
         I would fly, I would fly, <br/>
         I would fly on the wings of day. <br/></p>
