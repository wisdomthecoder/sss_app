<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Fading away like the stars of the morning,<br/>
         Losing their light in the glorious sun---- <br/>
         Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,<br/>
         Only remembered by what we have done.  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         Only remembered, only remembered, <br/>
         Only remembered by what we have done ; <br/>
         Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling, <br/>
         Only remembered by what we have done. </div>

         
         2 Shall we be missed, though by others <br/>
         succeeded, [time have sown ? <br/>
         Reaping the fields we in spring- <br/>
         Yes, but the sowers must pass from their labours,<br/>
         Ever remembered by what they have done. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Only the truth that in life we have spoken,<br/>
         Only the seed that on earth we have sown ; <br/>
         These shall pass onward when we are forgotten, <br/>
         Fruits of the harvest and what we have done. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Oh, when the Saviour shall make up His jewels,<br/>
         When the bright crowns of rejoicing are won, <br/>
         Then shall His weary and faithful disciples <br/>
         All be remembered by what they have done.<br/></p>
