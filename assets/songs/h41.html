<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 I have heard of Jesus in Bethlehem born,<br />
    Of whom it hath been said,<br />
    That a star the wise men followed from far,<br />
    Till they reached His lowly bed.
  <div class="chorus">
    He is my Saviour ! This same Jesus of<br />
    whom I've heard ;<br />
    He is my Saviour! I've found it in His Word.
  </div>
  2 I have heard of Jesus on Galilee's wave;<br />
  The wind obeyed His will,<br />
  And the sea grew calm at hearing His voice<br />
  In the wondrous Peace,be still !<br />
  <br />
  3 I have heard of Jesus at Bethany's home,<br />
  When standing by the grave,<br />
  How He cried, Come forth, O Lazarus,now!<br />
  In His mighty power to save.<br />
  <br />
  4 I have heard of Jesus on Calvary's brow,<br />
  He died a Saviour true ; <br />
  And He said, Forgive them, Father,<br />
  I pray, For they know not what they do.<br />
  <br />
  5 I have heard of Jesus in sepulchre laid,<br />
  In death's dark, sullen gloom ;<br />
  How He burst the bars, and rising, came forth,<br />
  Mighty Victor from the tomb.<br /></p>
