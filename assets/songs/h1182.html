<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 I have heard of a Saviour's love, <br/>
         And a wonderful love it must be; <br/>
         But did He come down from above, <br/>
         Out of love and compassion for me ? 
            
            <div class="chorus">
         This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all <br/>
         acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the <br/>
         world to save sinners. </div>

         2 I have heard how He suffered and bled, <br/>
         How He languished and died on the tree; <br/>
         But then is it anywhere said  <br/>
         That He languished and suffered for me ?<br/>
         <br/>
         He was wounded for our transgressions. <br/>
         He was bruised for our iniquities ; the chastise- <br/>
         ment of our peace was upon Him ; and with <br/>
         His stripes we are healed. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 I've been told of a heaven on high, <br/>
         Which the children of Jesus shall see ; <br/>
         But is there a place in the sky <br/>
         Made ready and furnished for me ? <br/>
         <br/>
         In My Father's house are many mansions : <br/>
         if it were not so, I would have told you. I go <br/>
             to prepare a place for you ; that where I am, <br/>
         there ye may be also. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Lord, answer these questions of mine ; <br/>
         To whom shall I go but to Thee ? <br/>
         And say, by Thy Spirit divine, <br/>
         There's a Saviour and heaven for me. <br/>
         <br/>
         Yes, yes, yes, for me ! for me ! Yes, yes, yes, <br/>
         for me ! <br/>
             Our Lord from above, in His infinite love, <br/>
         On the cross died to save you and me.<br/></p>
