<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 'Twas Jesus, my Saviour, who died on the tree,  <br/>
         To open a fountain for sinners like me ;<br/>
         His blood is that fountain which pardon bestows, <br/>
         And cleanses the foulest wherever it flows. 
            
        <div class="chorus">
         For the Lion of Judah shall break every chain, <br/>
         And give us the victory again and again. </div>

         
         2 And when I was willing with all <br/>
         things to part,<br/>
         He gave me His blessing, His love in my heart ; <br/>
         So now I am joined with the conquering band <br/>
         Who are marching to glory at Jesus' command. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Though round me the storms of adversity roll, <br/>
         And the waves of destruction encompass my soul,  <br/>
         In vain this frail vessel the tempest shall toss â€”  <br/>
         My hope is secure through the blood of the cross.<br/>
         <br/>
         4 And when with the ransomed, by Jesus, my Head, <br/>
         From fountain to fountain I then shall be led ; <br/>
         I'll fall at His feet and His mercy adore, <br/>
         And sing Hallelujah to God evermore. </p>
