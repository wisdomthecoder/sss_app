<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 There's a Friend for little children, <br/>
         Above the bright blue sky ; <br/>
         A Friend who never changeth, <br/>
         Whose love can never die. <br/>
         Unlike our friends by nature, <br/>
         Who change with changing years, <br/>
         This Friend is always worthy, <br/>
         The precious name He bears. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 There's a rest for little children, <br/>
         Above the bright blue sky ; <br/>
         Who love the blessed Saviour, <br/>
         And  Abba, Father, cry; <br/>
         A rest from every turmoil, <br/>
         From sin and danger free ; <br/>
         Where every little pilgrim <br/>
         Shall rest eternally. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 There's a home for little children, <br/>
         Above the bright blue sky ; <br/>
         Where Jesus reigns in glory, <br/>
         A home of peace and joy. <br/>
         No home on earth is like it, <br/>
         Nor can with it compare : <br/>
         For every one is happy, <br/>
         Nor could be happier, there. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 There's a crown for little children, <br/>
         Above the bright blue sky ; <br/>
         And all who look for Jesus <br/>
         Shall wear it by and by — <br/>
         A crown of brightest glory, <br/>
         Which He will then bestow <br/>
         On all who've found His favour <br/>
         And loved His name below. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 There's a song for little children, <br/>
         Above the bright blue sky — <br/>
         A song that will not weary, <br/>
         Though sung continually ; <br/>
         A song which even angels <br/>
         Can never, never sing; <br/>
         They know not Christ as Saviour, <br/>
         But worship Him as King. <br/>
         <br/>
         6 There's a robe for little children, <br/>
         Above the bright blue sky ; <br/>
         And a harp of sweetest music, <br/>
         And a palm of victory, <br/>
         All, all above is treasured, <br/>
         And found in Christ alone ; <br/>
         Oh, come, dear little children, <br/>
         That all may be your own. <br/></p>
