<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 One is our Master, the blessed Redeemer,<br/>
            Strong is the bond that unites us in Him ; <br/>
            Oh may the love His own Spirit hath kindled<br/>
            Burn with a light that will never grow dim.
            
            <div class="chorus">
            Brethren in Jesus, let us be faithful, <br/>
            Faithful to Him who is guiding our ways ; <br/>
            True in allegiance and loving obedience, <br/>
            Till in His glory hosannas we raise.</div>

            2 One is our Master; with gladness we'll serve Him, <br/>
            Doing the will of the Lord  from the heart, <br/>
            Knowing His strength is made perfect <br/>
            in weakness---- <br/>
            All that is needful His grace will impart. <br/>
            <br/>
            3 One is our Master, the highest and noblest,<br/>
            Yet in His tenderness always  the same  ; <br/>
            Be it our honour to follow His banner, <br/>
            Blessing for ever be unto His name. <br/>
            <br/>
            4 One is our Master; and happy those servants, <br/>
            Watching and ready when'er He may come ;<br/>
            Changed in His image, from  glory to glory, <br/>
            Joyful reward in His kingdom and home.</p>
