<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 I have read of a beautiful City, <br/>
         Far away in the kingdom of God ; <br/>
         I have read how its walls are of jasper, <br/>
         How its streets are all golden and broad. <br/>
         In the midst of the street is life's river, <br/>
         Clear as crystal, and pure to behold ; <br/>
         But not half of that City's bright glory <br/>
         To mortals has ever been told. 
            
            <div class="chorus">
         Not half has ever been told, . . <br/>
         Not half has ever been told ; . . <br/>
         Not half of that City's bright glory <br/>
         To mortals has ever been told. </div>

         2 1 have read of bright mansions in Heaven,  <br/>
         Which the Saviour has gone to prepare ;<br/>
         And the saints who on earth have been faithful, <br/>
         Rest for ever with Christ over there : <br/>
         There no sin ever enters, nor sorrow, <br/>
         The inhabitants never grow old; <br/>
         But not half of the joys that await them <br/>
         To mortals has ever been told. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 I have read of white robes for the righteous, <br/>
         Of bright crowns which the glorified wear,<br/>
         When our Father shall bid them  Come, enter, <br/>
         And My glory eternally share :  <br/>
         How the righteous are evermore blessed, <br/>
         As they walk through the streets of pure gold; <br/>
         But not half of the wonderful story <br/>
         To mortals has ever been told. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 I have read of a Christ so forgiving, <br/>
         That vile sinners may ask and receive <br/>
         Peace, and pardon for every transgression, <br/>
         If when asking they only believe. <br/>
         I have read how He'll guide and protect us,<br/>
         If for safety we enter His fold ;  <br/>
         But not half of His goodness and mercy <br/>
         To mortals has ever been told. <br/></p>
