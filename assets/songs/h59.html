<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 In tenderness He sought me, <br/>
    Weary and sick with sin, <br/>
    And on His shoulders brought me <br/>
    Back to His fold again ; <br/>
    While angels in His presence sang <br/>
    Until the courts of heaven rang. 
    <div class="chorus">
    Oh, the love that sought me ! <br/>
    Oh, the blood that bought me ! <br/>
    Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold ! <br/>
    Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold ! </div>

    2 lie found me bruised and dying, <br/>
    And poured in oil and wine ; <br/>
    He whispered to assure me, <br/>
    I've found thee â€” thou art <br/>
    Mine ! <br/>
    I never heard a sweeter voice, <br/>
    It made my aching heart rejoice ! <br/>
    <br/>
    3 He pointed to the nail-prints, <br/>
    For me His blood was shed ; <br/>
    A mocking crown so thorny <br/>
    Was placed upon His head, <br/>
    I wondered what He saw in me <br/>
    To suffer such deep agony. <br/>
    <br/>
    4 Fro sitting in His presence, <br/>
    The sunshine of His face, <br/>
    While with adoring wonder <br/>
    His blessings I retrace. <br/>
    It seems as if eternal days <br/>
    Are far too short to sound His praise. <br/>
    <br/>
    5 So while the hours are passing, <br/>
    All now is perfect rest ; <br/>
    I'm waiting for the morning, <br/>
    The brightest and the best, <br/>
    When He will call us to His side, <br/>
    To be with Him, His spotless Bride. <br/></p>
