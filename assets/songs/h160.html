<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 They come and go, the seasons fair,<br/>
            And bring their spoil to vale and hills;<br/>
            But oh, there is waiting in the air,<br/>
            And a passionate hope the spirit fills.<br/>
            Why doth He tarry, the absent Lord ?<br/>
            When shall the Kingdom be restored.<br/>
            And earth and heaven with one ac-cord, <br/>
            Ring out the cry that the King comes ?

    <div class="chorus"> 
            What will it be when the King comes !<br/>
            What will it be when the King comes !<br/>
            What will it be when He comes ! . .<br/>
            What will it be when the King comes!</div>
    
            2 The floods have lifted up their voice;<br/>
            The King hath come to His own—<br/>
            His own !<br/>
            The little hills and vales rejoice,<br/>
            His right it is to take the crown.<br/>
            Sleepers, awake, and meet Him first !<br/>
            Now let the marriage hymn outburst !<br/>
            And powers of darkness flee, disperst—<br/>
            What will it be when the King comes!<br/>
            <br/>
            3 A ransomed earth breaks forth in song,<br/>
            Her sin-stained ages over-past;<br/>
            Her yearning, Lord, how long, how long ?<br/>
            Exchanged for joy at last—at last !<br/>
            Angels, carry the royal commands;<br/>
            Peace beams forth throughout all the lands:<br/>
            The trees of the field shall clap their hands—<br/>
            What will it be when the King comes !<br/>
            <br/>
            4 Now Zion's hill, with glory crowned,<br/>
            Uplifts her head with joy once more;<br/>
            And Zion's King, once scorned, disowned,<br/>
            Extends her rule from shore to shore.<br/>
            Sing, for the land her Lord regains !<br/>
            Sing, for the Son of David reigns !<br/>
            And living streams o'erflow her plains—<br/>
            What will it be when the King comes !<br/>
            <br/>
            5 O brothers, stand as men that wait,<br/>
            The dawn is purpling in the east,<br/>
            And banners wave from heaven's high gate;<br/>
            The conflict now—but soon the feast.<br/>
            Mercy and truth shall meet again;<br/>
            Worthy the Lamb that once was slain;<br/>
            We can suffer now—He will know us then—<br/>
            What will it be when the King<br/>
            comes !<br/></p>
