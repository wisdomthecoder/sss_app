<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 The head that once was crowned with thorns<br/>
            Is crowned with glory now:<br/>
            A royal diadem adorns<br/>
            The mighty Victor's brow.<br/>
            <br/>
            2 The highest place that heaven affords<br/>
            Is His by sovereign right:<br/>
            The King of kings, and Lord of lords,<br/>
            He reigns in perfect light.<br/>
            <br/>
            3 The joy of all who dwell above,<br/>
            The joy of all below,<br/>
            To whom He manifests His love,<br/>
            And grants His name to know.<br/>
            <br/>
            4 To them the cross, with all its shame,<br/>
            With all its grace, is given:<br/>
            Their name, an everlasting name;<br/>
            Their joy, the joy of heaven.<br/>
            <br/>
            5 They suffer with their Lord below,<br/>
            They reign with Him above;<br/>
            Their profit and their bliss to know<br/>
            The fulness of His love.<br/>
            <br/>
            6 His cross to them is life and health,<br/>
            Though it was death to Him;<br/>
            Their present hope, and joy, and wealth,<br/>
            And their eternal theme, <br/></p>
