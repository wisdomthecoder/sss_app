  <p>1 Repeat the story o'er and o'er, <br/>
         Of grace so full and free ; <br/>
         I love to hear it more and more, <br/>
         Since grace has rescued me. 
            
            <div class="chorus">
         The half . . was never told, . . <br/>
         The half . . was never told, . . <br/>
         Of grace divine, so wonderful, <br/>
         The half . . was never told. . . </div>

         
         2 Of peace I only knew the name ; <br/>
         Nor found my soul its rest, <br/>
         Until the sweet-voiced angel came <br/>
         To soothe my weary breast. <br/>
         Of peace divine, so wonderful, <br/>
         The half . . was never told. . . <br/>
         <br/>
         3 My highest place is lying low <br/>
         At my Redeemer's feet ; <br/>
         No real joy in life I know, <br/>
         But in His service sweet. <br/>
         Of joy divine, so wonderful, <br/>
         The half . . was never told. . . <br/>
         <br/>
         4 And oh, what rapture will it be <br/>
         With all the host above, <br/>
         To sing through all eternity <br/>
         The wonders of His love ! <br/>
         Of love divine, so wonderful, <br/>
         The half . . was never told. . .</p>
