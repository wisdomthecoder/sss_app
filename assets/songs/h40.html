  <p>1 Jesus, my Saviour, to Bethlehem came,<br/>
    Born in a manger to sorrow and shame;<br/>
    Oh, it was wonderful-- blest be His name!<br/>
    Seeking for me, for me!<br/>
    Seeking for me ! for me ! . .<br/>
    Seeking for me ! for me ! . .<br/>

    2 Jesus, my Saviour, on Calvary's tree,<br/>
    Paid the great debt, and my soul He set free;<br/>
    Oh, it was wonderful-- how could it be?--<br/>
    Dying for me, for me !<br/>
    Dying for me ! for me ! . .<br/>

    3 Jesus, my Saviour, the same as of old,<br/>
    While I was wand'ring afar from the fold,<br/>
    Gently and long did He plead with my soul,<br/>
    Calling for me, for me !<br/>
    Calling for me ! for me ! . .<br/>
    Calling for me ! for me ! . .<br/>
    Gently and long did He plead with my soul,<br/>
    Calling for me, for me !<br/>

    4 Jesus, my Saviour, shall come from on high--<br/>
    Sweet is the promise as weary years fly ;<br/>
    Oh, I shall see Him descend from the sky,<br/>
    Coming for me, for me !<br/>
    Coming for me ! for me ! . .<br/>
    Coming for me ! for me ! . .<br/>
    Oh, I shall see Him descend from the sky,<br/>
