  <p>1 O aching heart, with sorrow torn, <br/>
         Thy Lord is near and knows ! <br/>
         He knows it all -----the feet way-worn, <br/>
         The weary cares and woes, <br/>
         The load of grief in anguish borne,<br/>
         Thy Lord is near: ... He knows.  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         He knows, . . He knows ; . . <br/>
         Thy Lord is near : He knows. </div>

         
         2 O fainting soul, with doubts oppressed, <br/>
         Thy Lord is near and knows ! <br/>
         He knows it all-----how thou art pressed <br/>
         On every side with foes, <br/>
         He waits to be thy cherished Guest ; <br/>
         Thy Lord is near: ... He knows. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 O weary head, that fain would rest, <br/>
         Thy Lord is near and knows ! <br/>
         He knows it all, and on His breast <br/>
         Thou raayest now repose ; <br/>
         Drop every care at His behest ; <br/>
         Thy Lord is near : He knows. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 O lonely one, live thou thy best, <br/>
         Thy Lord is near and knows ! <br/>
         He knows it all, sees every test----- <br/>
         Yes, every tear that flows : <br/>
         Rejoice, faint heart, His way is best ; <br/>
         Thy Lord is near : He knows. <br/></p>
