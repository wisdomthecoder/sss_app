  <p>1 I will sing the wondrous story <br/>
         Of the Christ who died for me ; <br/>
         How He left His home in glory, <br/>
         For the cross on Calvary.  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         Yes, I'll sing . . . the wondrous sto - - - ry <br/>
         Of the Christ . . . who died for me ; . . . <br/>
         Sing it with . . . the saints in glo - - - ry, <br/>
         Gathered by . . . the crystal sea. . . . </div>

         
         2 I was lost ; but Jesus found me — <br/>
         Found the sheep that went astray ; <br/>
         Threw His loving arms around me, <br/>
         Drew me back into His way. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 I was bruised : but Jesus healed me — <br/>
         Faint was I from many a fall ; <br/>
         Sight was gone, and fears possessed me : <br/>
         But He freed me from them all. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Days of darkness still come o'er me ; <br/>
         Sorrow's paths I often tread ; <br/>
         But the Saviour still is with me, <br/>
         By His hand I'm safely led. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 He will keep me till the river <br/>
         Rolls its waters at my feet ; <br/>
         Then He'll bear me safely over, <br/>
         Where the loved ones I shall meet. <br/></p>
