<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 There were ninety and nine that safely lay <br/>
    In the shelter of the fold,<br/>
    But one was out on the hills away, <br/>
    Far off from the gates of gold — <br/>
    Away on the mountains wild and bare, <br/>
    Away from the tender Shepherd's care. <br/>
    <br/>
    2  Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine ; <br/>
    Are they not enough for Thee ?  <br/>
    But the Shepherd made answer: <br/>
    This of Mine <br/>
    Has wandered away from Me; <br/>
    And although the road be rough and steep, <br/>
    I go to the desert to find My sheep. <br/>
    <br/>
    3 But none of the ransomed ever knew <br/>
    How deep were the waters crossed ; <br/>
    Nor how dark was the night that the <br/>
    Lord passed through [lost. <br/>
    Ere He found His sheep that was <br/>
    Out in the desert He heard its cry — <br/>
    Sick and helpless, and ready to die. <br/>
    <br/>
    4  Lord, whence are those blood-drops <br/>
    all the way [track ?  <br/>
    That mark out the mountain's <br/>
    They were shed for one who had gone astray <br/>
    Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.<br/>
    Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn ?  <br/>
    They are pierced to-night by many a thorn. <br/>
    <br/>
    5 But all through the mountains, thunder-riven, <br/>
    And up from the rocky steep, <br/>
    There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,  <br/>
    Rejoice ! I have found My sheep !<br/>
    And the angels echoed around the throne,  <br/>
    Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own ! <br/></p>
