
  1 Pray, brethren, pray ! 
         The sands are falling ; 
         Pray, brethren, pray ! 
         God's voice is calling. 
         Yon turret strikes the dying chime ; 
         We kneel upon the verge of time :  
            
        Chorus
         Eternity is drawing nigh ! 
         Eternity is drawing nigh ! 

         
         2 Praise, brethren, praise ! 
         The skies are rending ; 
         Praise, brethren, praise ! 
         The fight is ending ; 
         Behold, the glory draweth near, 
         The King Himself will soon appear : 
         
         3 Watch, brethren, watch ! 
         The year is dying ; 
         Watch, brethren, watch ! 
         Old time is flying ! 
         Watch as men watch the parting breath, 
         Watch as men watch for life or death : 
         
         4 Look, brethren, look ! 
         The day is breaking ; 
         Hark, brethren, hark ! 
         The dead are waking : 
         With girded loins all ready stand ; 
         Behold, the Bridegroom is at hand ! 
         
         Eternity is drawing nigh ! 
         Eternity is drawing nigh ! is drawing nigh !
