<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 O soul, tossed on the billows, <br/>
         Afar from friendly land, <br/>
         Look up to Him who holds thee <br/>
         In  the hollow of His hand. 
            
            <div class="chorus">
         In the hollow of His hand ! <br/>
         In the hollow of His hand !----<br/>
         Oh, how safe are all who trust Him, <br/>
         In the hollow of His hand ! </div>

         
         2 Though raging winds may drive thee <br/>
         A wreck upon the strand, <br/>
         Still cling to Him who holds thee <br/>
         In  the hollow of His hand. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 When strength is spent in toiling, <br/>
         And wearily you stand, <br/>
         Then rest in Him who holds thee <br/>
         In  the hollow of His hand. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 When by the swelling Jordan, <br/>
         Your feet in sinking sand, <br/>
         Remember still He holds thee <br/>
         In  the hollow of His hand. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 And when at last we're gathered <br/>
         With all the ransomed band, <br/>
         We'll praise our God who holds us <br/>
         In  the hollow of His hand.</p>
