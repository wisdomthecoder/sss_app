  1 Jesus, Thine all-victorious love 
            Shed in my soul abroad ; 
            Then shall my heart no longer rove, 
            Rooted and fixed in God. 
            
            2 Oh that in me the sacred fire 
            Might now begin to glow ! 
            Burn up the dross of base desire, 
            And make the mountains flow. 
            
            3 Thou, who at Pentecost didst fall, 
            Do Thou my sins consume ; 
            Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call; 
            Spirit of Burning, come ! 
            
            4 Refining Fire, go through my heart, 
            Illuminate my soul ; 
            Scatter Thy life through every part, 
            And sanctify the whole. 
            
            5 My steadfast soul, from falling free, 
            Shall then no longer move, 
            While Christ is all the world to me, 
            And all my heart is love.
