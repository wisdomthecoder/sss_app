<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 I love to think, though I am young, <br/>
         My Saviour was a child ; <br/>
         That Jesus walked this earth along, <br/>
         With feet all undefined. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 He kept His Father's word of truth, <br/>
         As I am taught to do ; <br/>
         And while He walked the paths of youth, <br/>
         He walked in wisdom too. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 I love to think that He who spake, <br/>
         And made the blind to see, <br/>
         And called the sleeping dead to wake, <br/>
         Was once a child like me. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 That He who wore the thorny crown, <br/>
         And tasted death's despair, <br/>
         Had a kind mother like my own, <br/>
         And knew her love and care. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 I know 'twas all for love of me <br/>
         That He became a child, <br/>
         And left the heavens so fair to see, <br/>
         And trod earth's pathway wild. <br/>
         <br/>
         6 Then, Saviour, who wast once a child, <br/>
         A child may come to Thee ; <br/>
         And oh, in all Thy mercy mild, <br/>
         Dear Saviour, come to me ! <br/></p>
