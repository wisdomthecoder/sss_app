<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Once it was the blessing, now it is the Lord;  <br/>
         Once it was the feeling, now it is His Word;<br/>
         Once His gifts I wanted, now the <br/>
         Giver own ; <br/>
         Once I sought for healing, now Himself alone. 
            
            <div class="chorus">
         All in all for ever, Jesus will I sing ; <br/>
         Everything in Jesus, and Jesus everything. </div>

         
         2 Once 'twas painful trying, now 'tis <br/>
         perfect trust ;<br/>
         Once a half salvation, now the uttermost ; <br/>
         Once 'twas ceaseless holding, now He <br/>
         holds me fast ; <br/>
         Once 'twas constant drifting, now my anchor's cast.<br/>
         <br/>
         3 Once 'twas busy planning, now 'tis <br/>
         trustful prayer;  <br/>
         Once 'twas anxious caring, now He has the care;<br/>
         Once 'twas what I wanted, now what <br/>
         Jesus says ; <br/>
         Once 'twas constant asking, now 'tis ceaseless praise.<br/>
         <br/>
         4 Once it was my working, His it hence <br/>
         shall be ;  <br/>
         Once I tried to use Him, now He uses me ;<br/>
         Once the power I wanted, now the <br/>
         Mighty One ;<br/>
         Once for self I laboured, now for Him alone. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 Once I hoped in Jesus, now I know <br/>
         He's mine ;<br/>
         Once my lamps were dying, now they brightly shine ;  <br/>
         Once for death I waited, now His <br/>
         coming hail ; <br/>
         And my hopes are anchored safe within the veil.</p>
