  <p>1 There's a wonderful story I've heard long ago, <br/>
         'Tis called  The sweet story of old  ;<br/>
         I hear it so often, wherever I go <br/>
         That same old story is told ; <br/>
         And I've thought it was strange that <br/>
         so often they'd tell <br/>
         That story as if it were new ; <br/>
         But I've found out the reason they <br/>
         loved it so well — <br/>
         That old, old story is true !  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         That old, old story is true, <br/>
         That old, old story is true ; <br/>
         But I've found out the reason they loved it so <br/>
         That old, old story is true ! [well — </div>

         
         2 They told of a Saviour so lovely and pure, <br/>
         That came to the earth to dwell, <br/>
         To seek for His lost ones, and make them secure <br/>
         From death and the power of hell ; <br/>
         That He was despised, and with <br/>
         thorns He was crowned, <br/>
         On the cross was extended to view ; <br/>
         But oh, what sweet peace in my heart since I've found <br/>
         That old, old story is true ! <br/>
         But oh, what sweet peace in my heart since <br/>
         That old, old story is true 1 [I've found <br/>
         <br/>
         3 He arose and ascended to heaven, we're told, <br/>
         Triumphant o'er death and hell ; <br/>
         He's preparing a place in that city of gold,  <br/>
         Where loved ones for ever may dwell ;<br/>
         Where our kindred we'll meet, and <br/>
         we'll nevermore part ; <br/>
         And oh, while I tell it to you, <br/>
         It is peace to my soul, it is joy to my heart — <br/>
         That old, old story is true ! <br/>
         It is peace to my soul, it is joy to my heart- <br/>
         That old, old story is true 1 <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Oh, that wonderful story I love to repeat, <br/>
         Of peace and goodwill to men ; <br/>
         There's no story to me that is half so sweet, <br/>
         As I hear it again and again. <br/>
         He invites you to come — He will freely receive, <br/>
         And this message He sendeth to you, <br/>
         There's a mansion in glory for all who believe, <br/>
         That old, old story is true. <br/>
         There's a mansion in glory for all who <br/>
         That old, old story is true I [believe, <br/></p>
