<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 I was a wandering sheep, <br/>
            I did not love the fold ; <br/>
            I did not love my Shepherd's voice, <br/>
            I would not be controlled : <br/>
            I was a wayward child, <br/>
            I did not love my home, <br/>
            I did not love my Father's voice, <br/>
            I loved afar to roam. <br/>
            <br/>
            2 The Shepherd sought His sheep, <br/>
            The Father sought His child ; <br/>
            They followed me o'er vale and hill, <br/>
            O'er deserts waste and wild : <br/>
            They found me nigh to death, <br/>
            Famished, and faint, and lone ; <br/>
            They bound me with the bands of love, <br/>
            They saved the wandering one. <br/>
            <br/>
            3 Jesus my Shepherd is, <br/>
            'Twas He that loved my soul ; <br/>
            'Twas He that washed me in His blood, <br/>
            'Twas He that made me whole ; <br/>
            'Twas He that sought the lost, <br/>
            That found the wandering sheep ; <br/>
            â€˜Twas He that brought me to the fold, <br/>
            'Tis He that still doth keep. <br/>
            <br/>
            4 I was a wandering sheep, <br/>
            I would not be controlled ; <br/>
            But now I love my Saviour's voice, <br/>
            I love, I love the fold. <br/>
            I was a wayward child, <br/>
            I once preferred to roam ; <br/>
            But now I love my Father's voice---- <br/>
            I love, I love His home. <br/></p>
