  1 I lay my sins on Jesus, 
         The spotless Lamb of God ; 
         He bears them all, and frees us 
         From the accurs6d load. 
         I bring my guilt to Jesus. 
         To wash my crimson stains, 
         White in His blood most precious, 
         Till not a spot remains. 
         
         2 I lay my wants on Jesus, 
         All fulness dwells in Him ; 
         He heals all my diseases, 
         He doth my soul redeem. 
         I lay my griefs on Jesus, 
         My burdens and my cares : 
         He from them all releases ; 
         He all my sorrow shares. 
         
         3 I rest my soul on Jesus, 
         This weary soul of mine ; 
         His right hand me embraces, 
         I on His breast recline. 
         I love the name of Jesus, 
         Immanuel, Christ, the Lord : 
         Like fragrance on the breezes, 
         His name abroad is poured. 
         
         4 I long to be like Jesus, 
         Meek, loving, lowly, mild; 
         I long to be like Jesus, 
         The Father's holy child. 
         I long to be with Jesus 
         Amid the heavenly throng, 
         To sing with saints His praises, 
         To learn the angels' song.
