<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 As I wandered round the homestead, <br/>
         Many a dear familiar spot <br/>
         Brought within my recollection <br/>
         Scenes I'd seemingly forgot; <br/>
         There, the orchard — meadow, yonder — <br/>
         Here, the deep, old-fashioned well, <br/>
         With its old moss-covered bucket, <br/>
         Sent a thrill no tongue can tell. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 Though the house was held by strangers, <br/>
         All remained the same within; <br/>
         Just as when a child I rambled <br/>
         Up and down, and out and in ; <br/>
         To the garret dark ascending — <br/>
         Once a source of childish dread — <br/>
         Peering through the misty cobwebs, <br/>
         Lo ! I saw my cradle bed. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Quick I drew it from the rubbish <br/>
         Covered o'er with dust so long : <br/>
         When, behold, I heard in fancy <br/>
         Strains of one familiar song, <br/>
         Often sung by my dear mother <br/>
         To me in that cradle bed : <br/>
         Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber ! <br/>
         Holy angels guard thy bed !  <br/>
         <br/>
         4 While I listen to the music <br/>
         <br/>
         Stealing on in gentle strain, <br/>
         I am carried back to childhood — <br/>
         I am now a child again : <br/>
         'Tis the hour of my retiring, <br/>
         At the dusky eventide ; <br/>
         Near my cradle bed I'm kneeling, <br/>
         As of yore, by mother's side. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 Hands are on my head so loving, <br/>
         As they were in childhood's days; <br/>
         I, with weary tones, am trying <br/>
         To repeat the words she says ; <br/>
         'Tis a prayer in language simple <br/>
         As a mother's lips can frame : <br/>
         Father, Thou who art in heaven, <br/>
         Hallowed, ever, be Thy name. <br/>
         <br/>
         6 Prayer is over : to my pillow <br/>
         With a  good-night  kiss I creep, <br/>
         Scarcely waking while I whisper, <br/>
         Now I lay me down to sleep. <br/>
         Then my mother, o'er me bending, <br/>
         Prays in earnest words, but mild : <br/>
         Hear my prayer, O heavenly Father, <br/>
         Bless, oh bless, my precious child !  <br/>
         <br/>
         7 Yet I am but only dreaming : <br/>
         Ne'er I'll be a child again ; <br/>
         Many years has that dear mother <br/>
         In the quiet graveyard lain ; <br/>
         But her blessed angel spirit <br/>
         Daily hovers o'er my head, <br/>
         Calling me from earth to heaven, <br/>
         Even from my cradle bed. <br/></p>
