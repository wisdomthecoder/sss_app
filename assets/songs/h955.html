<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 O'er the cold and chilly blast, <br/>
         By and by, by and by ! <br/>
         We shall gather home at last, <br/>
         By and by, by and by ! <br/>
         Far beyond the stormy gale, <br/>
         Anchored safe within the vail, <br/>
         We shall furl our shattered sail, <br/>
         By and by, by and by ! <br/>
         <br/>
         2 We shall see our Saviour's face <br/>
         By and by, by and by ! <br/>
         We shall sing redeeming grace, <br/>
         By and by, by and by ! <br/>
         Where the rose and lily grow, <br/>
         Where our tears shall cease to flow, <br/>
         Oh, the joy that we shall know <br/>
         By and by, by and by ! <br/>
         <br/>
         3 In the golden fields above, <br/>
         By and by, by and by ! <br/>
         We shall meet the friends we love, <br/>
         By and by, by and by ! <br/>
         On that pure and fragrant shore <br/>
         All our trials will be o'er, <br/>
         We shall say farewell no more <br/>
         By and by, by and by ! <br/></p>
