<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 I will tell the precious story, <br/>
         And proclaim the wondrous love <br/>
         Of my Saviour now in glory, <br/>
         Seated on His throne above ; <br/>
         Once He came, despised, rejected, <br/>
         Everlasting life to bring ; <br/>
         Now exalted Prince and Saviour â€” <br/>
         He is Salem's mighty King !  
            
        <div class="chorus">
         He is Je - - sus crucified ; <br/>
         For am-- ined world He died j <br/>
         Now He reigns in heaven for ever <br/>
         With the saved and glorified. </div>

         
         2 Though His name is high and holy, <br/>
         And His kingdom so secure, <br/>
         Yet He dwells with all the lowly, <br/>
         If their hearts are only pure ; <br/>
         Never yet was love so tender, <br/>
         Never promise half so sweet, <br/>
         Peace He gives when we surrender, <br/>
         Sitting meekly at His feet. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 When by sin and anguish driven <br/>
         With our needs before the throne, <br/>
         If we ask for bread from heaven, <br/>
         Will He give to us a stone ? <br/>
         No : He'll hear our sad repining, <br/>
         For He feels our every woe ; <br/>
         And will pour us out a blessing, <br/>
         That will surely overflow. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Do you fear the coming morrow, <br/>
         With its crosses yet unknown ? <br/>
         Have you any care or sorrow <br/>
         That you cannot bear alone ?<br/>
         Do not yield to sad complaining, <br/>
         All your burdens on Him cast ; <br/>
         Let your light be ever shining, <br/>
         Faith will bring you home at last. <br/></p>
