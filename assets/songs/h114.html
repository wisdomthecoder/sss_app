<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>Look away to the cross of the  Cruci-fied One, <br/>
            Where He purchased salvation for you;<br/>
            When He laid down His life, and completed the work<br/>
            That the Father had sent Him to do.

    <div class="chorus"> 
            Room at the cross, there is room at the cross,<br/>
            And a welcome that all may receive;<br/>
            There is room at the cross of the Crucified One,<br/>
            And redemption for all who believe.</div>
    
            2 Look away to the cross of the Cruci-fied Oue, <br/>
            To the Cross where He suffered and bled;<br/>
            And to-day He invites you to come if you will, <br/>
            And be cleansed in the blood that He shed.<br/>
            <br/>
            3 Look away to the cross of the Cruci-fied One, <br/>
            Where the wine-press alone He hath trod;<br/>
            Where He cried in His anguish,<br/>
            is finished, 'tis done!<br/>
            And commended His spirit to God.<br/>
            <br/>
            4 There is life at the cross of the Cruci-fied One,<br/>
            And its hope is abiding and sure;<br/>
            For the rapture that flows from the love He bestows<br/>
            Shall for ever and ever endure.<br/></p>
