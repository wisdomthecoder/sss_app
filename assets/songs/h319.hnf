  1 What a Friend we have in Jesus, 
            All our sins and griefs to bear ! 
            What a privilege to carry 
            Everything to God in prayer ! 
            Oh, what peace we often forfeit, 
            Oh, what needless pain we bear------ 
            All because we do not carry 
            Everything to God in prayer ! 
            
            2 Have we trials and temptations ? 
            Is there trouble anywhere ? 
            We should never be discouraged ; 
            Take it to the Lord in prayer. 
            Can we find a Friend so faithful, 
            Who will all our sorrows share? 
            Jesus knows our every weakness-----
            Take it to the Lord in prayer ! 
            
            3 Are we weak and heavy-laden, 
            Cumbered with a load of care ? 
            Precious Saviour, still our refuge-----
            Take it to the Lord in prayer. 
            Do thy friends despise, forsake thee ? 
            Take it to the Lord in prayer ; 
            In His arms He'll take and shield thee.
            Thou wilt find a solace there,
