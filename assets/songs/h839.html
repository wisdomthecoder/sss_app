  <p>1 Only to know that the path I tread <br/>
         Is the path marked out for me ; <br/>
         That the way, though thorny, rough, and steep, <br/>
         Will lead me nearer to Thee ! <br/>
         Nearer to Thee ! nearer to Thee ! <br/>
         Blessed Redeemer, to Thee ! <br/>
         Only to know that the path I tread <br/>
         Is bringing me nearer to Thee ! <br/>
         <br/>
         2 Only to know when the day is past, <br/>
         And the evening shadows come, <br/>
         That its trials and cares have proved indeed <br/>
         A  day's march nearer home  ! <br/>
         Nearer my home ! nearer my home ! <br/>
         Nearer my beautiful home ! <br/>
         Only to know that each fast-fleeting day<br/>
         Is bringing me nearer home ! <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Only to know that the cross I see <br/>
         Is the cross of Calvary, <br/>
         On which the world's Redeemer died, <br/>
         To purchase life for me ! [me ! <br/>
         Purchased for me ! purchased for <br/>
         Life Thou hast purchased for me! <br/>
         Only to know that Thy death on the cross <br/>
         Brings light and life to me ! <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Only to know His peace within, <br/>
         My will to His resigned ; <br/>
         Oh, fill me with Thy fulness, Lord, <br/>
         And make me wholly Thine ! <br/>
         Wholly Thine ! wholly Thine ! <br/>
         Now and for ever Thine ! <br/>
         Fill me with love and peace divine, <br/>
         And make me wholly Thine ! <br/></p>
