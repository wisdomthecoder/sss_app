
  1 Oh, the weary night is waning,
            And the clouds are rolling by;
            See, the long-expected morning
            Now is dawning in the sky;
            When from Zion's lofty mountain
            We shall hear the watchmen cry,
            And rejoicing we shall gather
            When the King shall come.
            
            Chorus
            O Zion ! O Zion ! Great will be thy triumph
            When the King shall come;
            O Zion ! O Zion ! Thou shalt be exalted
            When the King shall come.
          
          
            2 When the ransomed of Jehovah,
            From the East and from the West,
            Shall return with joy and gladness,
            To receive the promised restâ€”
            Then shall every tribe and nation
            Out of every land be blessed,
            And rejoicing they shall gather
            When the King shall come.
            
            3 May He find us, when He cometh,
            Faithful watchers, day and night,
            At our royal post of duty,
            With our armour shining bright;
            May our lamps be trimmed and burning
            With a clear and steady light, 
            That rejoicing we may gather
            When the King shall come.
