  <p>NOT saved are we trying,<br/>
            From self can come no aid;<br/>
            ‘Tis on the Blood relying,<br/>
            Once for our ransom paid.<br/>
            Tis looking unto Jesus, <br/>
            The holy One and just ; <br/>

            2 ‘Twas vain for Israel bitten <br/>
            By serpents, on their way, <br/>
            To look to their own doing, <br/>
            That awful plague to stay ; <br/>
            The only means for healing, <br/>
            When humbled in the dust, <br/>
            Was of the Lord's revealing----<br/>
            It was not Try, but Trust ! <br/>
            <br/>
            3 No deeds of ours are needed <br/>
            To make Christ's merit more ; <br/>
            No frames of mind, or feelings, <br/>
            Can add to His great store ; <br/>
            'Tis simply to receive Him, <br/>
            The holy One and just ; <br/>
            'Tis only to believe Him---- <br/>
            It is not Try, but Trust ! <br/></p>
