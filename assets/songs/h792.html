  <p>1 Who is on the Lord's side ? who will serve the King ?<br/>
         Who will be His helpers, other lives to bring ? <br/>
         Who will leave the world's side ? who <br/>
         will face the foe ? <br/>
         Who is on the Lord's side ? who for Him will go ?  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         Who is on the Lord's side ? who will serve the King ? <br/>
         Who will be His helpers, other fives to bring ? <br/>
         By Thy grand redemption, by Thy grace divine, <br/>
         We are on the Lord's side ; Saviour, we are Thine ! </div>

         
         2 Not for weight of glory, not for crown and palm,<br/>
         Enter we the army, raise the warrior-psalm ; <br/>
         But for love that claimeth lives for <br/>
         whom He died : <br/>
         He whom Jesus nameth must be on His side! <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Jesus, Thou hast bought us, not with gold or gem,<br/>
         But with Thine own life-blood, for Thy diadem ; <br/>
         With Thy blessing filling all who come to Thee, <br/>
         Thou hast made us willing, Thou hast made us free.<br/>
         <br/>
         4 Fierce may be the conflict, strong <br/>
         may be the foe ; <br/>
         But the King's own army none can overthrow ; <br/>
         Round His standard ranging, victory is secure,<br/>
         For His truth unchanging makes the triumph sure. <br/></p>
