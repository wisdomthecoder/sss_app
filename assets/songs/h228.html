<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 The church's one foundation <br/>
            Is Jesus Christ her Lord ; <br/>
            She is His new creation <br/>
            By water and the Word : <br/>
            From Heaven He came and sought her<br/>
            To be His holy bride ;  <br/>
            With His own blood He bought her, <br/>
            And for her life He died. <br/>
            <br/>
            2 Elect from every nation, <br/>
            Yet one o'er all the earth ; <br/>
            Her charter of salvation---- <br/>
            One Lord, one faith, one birth; <br/>
            One holy Name she blesses, <br/>
            Partakes one holy food ; <br/>
            And to one hope she presses, <br/>
            With every grace endued. <br/>
            <br/>
            3Though with a scornful wonder <br/>
            Men see her sore opprest, <br/>
            By schisms rent asunder, <br/>
            By heresies distrest : <br/>
            Yet saints their watch are keeping, <br/>
            Their cry goes up,  How long ?  <br/>
            And soon the night of weeping <br/>
            Shall be the morn of song. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            4 'Mid toil and tribulation, <br/>
            And tumults of her war, <br/>
            She waits the consummation <br/>
            Of peace for evermore ; <br/>
            Till with the vision glorious <br/>
            Her longing eyes are blest, <br/>
            And the great church victorious, <br/>
            Shall be the church at rest. <br/>
            <br/>
            5 Yet she on earth hath union <br/>
            With God the Three in One, <br/>
            And mystic sweet communion <br/>
            With those whose rest is won: <br/>
            Oh, happy ones and holy ! <br/>
            Lord, give us grace, that we, <br/>
            Like them, the meek and lowly, <br/>
            On high may dwell with Thee ! <br/></p>
