<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 It came to me one precious day, <br/>
         That I had grieved my Lord away ; <br/>
         It smote me with a sense of loss, <br/>
         And drove me to His blessed cross.  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         By faith I saw Him on the tree ; <br/>
         'Twas there His blood was shed for me ; <br/>
         And by that look, O love divine, <br/>
         I now am His, and He is mine. </div>

         
         2 It came to me that joyful day, <br/>
         That He would take my sins away, <br/>
         If I to Him would trust my all, <br/>
         And on His name but humbly call. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 It came to me that golden day, <br/>
         That in my heart He'd come and stay, <br/>
         And there abide for evermore, <br/>
         If I would open wide the door. <br/></p>
