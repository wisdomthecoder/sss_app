
  1 O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head !
            Our load was laid on Thee;
            Thou stoodest in the sinner's stead,
            Didst bear all ill for me.
            A Victim led, Thy blood was shed !
            Now there's no load for me.
            
            2 Death and the curse were in our cup:
            O Christ, 'twas full for Thee !
            Bat Thou hast drained the last dark drop,
            Tis empty now for me:
            That bitter cup, love drank it up,
            Now blessing's draught for me.
            
            3 Jehovah lifted up His rod:
            O Christ, it fell on Thee !
            Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God;
            There's not one stroke for me.
            Thy tears. Thy blood, beneath it flowed;
            Thy bruising healeth me.
            
            4 The tempest's awful voice was heard;
            O Christ, it broke on Thee !
            Thy open bosom was my ward,
            It braved the storm for me.
            Thy form was scarred, Thy visage
            marred;
            Now cloudless peace for me.
            
            5 Jehovah bade His sword awake,
            O Christ, it woke 'gainst Thee;
            Thy blood the flaming blade must
            slake,
            Thy heart its sheath must be.
            All for my sake, my peace to make:
            Now sleeps that sword for me.
            
            6 For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
            And I have died in Thee:
            Thou'rt risenâ€”my bands are all un-tied;
            And now Thou liv'st in me;
            When purified, made white, and tried,
            Thy glory then for me.
