<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 There is a green hill far away, <br/>
         Without a city wall, <br/>
         Where the dear Lord was crucified, <br/>
         Who died to save us all. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 We may not know, we cannot tell, <br/>
         What pains He had to bear ; <br/>
         But we believe it was for us <br/>
         He hung and suffered there. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 He died that we might be forgiven, <br/>
         He died to make us good, <br/>
         That we might go at last to heaven, <br/>
         Saved by His precious blood. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 There was no other good enough <br/>
         To pay the price of sin ; <br/>
         He only could unlock the gate <br/>
         Of heaven, and let us in. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved ! <br/>
         And we must love Him too ; <br/>
         And trust in His redeeming blood, <br/>
         And try His works to do. <br/></p>
