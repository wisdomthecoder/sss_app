  <p>1 He feedeth His flock like a Shepherd, <br/>
         Where pastures are blooming and fair; <br/>
         He gathers the lambs in His bosom, <br/>
         And shelters them tenderly there.

         2 He feedeth His flock like a Shepherd ; <br/>
         And when in the desert they roam, <br/>
         He patiently follows their footsteps, <br/>
         Arid leadeth them tenderly home. <br/>
         <br/>

         The weakest His kindness may claim ; <br/>
         He never will leave nor forsake them <br/>
         Who trust in His excellent name. <br/></p>
