<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 The dawn of God's dear Sabbath <br/>
            Breaks o'er the earth again. <br/>
            As some sweet summer morning <br/>
            After a night of pain : <br/>
            It comes as cooling showers <br/>
            To some exhausted land, <br/>
            As shade of clustered palm trees <br/>
            'Mid weary wastes of sand. <br/>
            <br/>
            2 O day, when earthly sorrow <br/>
            Is merged in heavenly joy, <br/>
            And trial changed to blessing <br/>
            That foes may not destroy ; <br/>
            When want is turned to fulness, <br/>
            And weariness to rest ; <br/>
            And pain to wondrous rapture, <br/>
            Upon the Saviour's breast. <br/>
            <br/>
            3 Lord, we would bring for offering, <br/>
            Though marred with earthly soil, <br/>
            A week of earnest labour, <br/>
            Of steady, faithful toil ; <br/>
            Fair fruits of self-denial, <br/>
            Of strong, deep love to Thee, <br/>
            Fostered by Thine own Spirit <br/>
            In our humility. <br/>
            <br/>
            4 And we would bring our burden <br/>
            Of sinful thought and deed, <br/>
            In Thy pure presence kneeling, <br/>
            From bondage to be freed ; <br/>
            Our hearts' most bitter sorrow <br/>
            For all Thy work undone,------ <br/>
            So many talents wasted, <br/>
            So few bright laurels won ! <br/>
            <br/>
            5 So be it, Lord, for ever : <br/>
            Oh, may we evermore, <br/>
            In Jesus' holy presence, <br/>
            His blessed name adore : <br/>
            Upon His peaceful Sabbath, <br/>
            Within His temple walls, <br/>
            Type of the stainless worship <br/>
            In Zion's golden halls ; <br/>
            <br/>
            6 So that in joy and gladness <br/>
            We reach that home at last ; <br/>
            When life's short week of sorrow, <br/>
            And sin, and strife is past ; <br/>
            When angel-hands have gathered <br/>
            The fair ripe fruit for Thee, <br/>
            O Father, Lord, Redeemer, <br/>
            Most Holy Trinity. <br/></p>
