
  1 A few more years shall roll, 
         A few more seasons come, 
         And we shall be with those that rest 
         Asleep within the tomb.  
            
            Chorus
         Then, O my Lord, prepare 
         My soul for that great day; 
         Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood* 
         And take my sins away. 

         
         2 A few more suns shall set, 
         O'er these dark hills of time ; 
         And we shall be where suns are not, 
         A far serener clime. 
         
         3 A few more storms shall beat 
         On this wild, rocky shore ; 
         And we shall be where tempests cease, 
         And surges swell no more. 
         
         4 A few more struggles here, 
         A few more partings o'er ; 
         A few more toils, a few more tears, 
         And we shall weep no more. 
         
         5 Tis but a little while 
         And He shall come again,  
         Who died that we might live; who lives 
         That we with Him may reign.
