  <p>1 O brother, have you told how the Lord forgave ? <br/>
         Let us hear you tell it over once again ; <br/>
         Thy coming to the cross where He died to save,  <br/>
         Let us hear you tell it over once again.<br/>
         Are you walking now in His blessed light ?  <br/>
         Are you cleansed from every guilty stain ? <br/>
         Is He your joy by day and your song by night ?  <br/>
         Let us hear you tell it over once again.<br/>
         <br/>
         Let us hear . . . you tell it o - ver, . . tell it <br/>
         o ver once again ; . . . <br/>
         Tell the sweet and blessed story, <br/>
         It will help you on to glory — <br/>
         Let us hear you tell it over once again. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 When toiling up the way, was the <br/>
         Saviour there ? <br/>
         Let us hear you tell it over once again ;<br/>
         Did Jesus bear you up in His tender care ?  <br/>
         Let us hear you tell it over once again. <br/>
         Never have you found such a friend as He, <br/>
         Who can help you 'midst the toil and pain ; <br/>

         He's done for thee ;  <br/>

         bless6d theme ?  <br/>

         'Tis ever sweeter far than the sweetest dream —  <br/>
         Let us hear you tell it over once again.<br/>

         Who have sought for rest, and all in vain ; <br/>

         Let us hear you tell it over once again.<br/>

         Let us hear you tell it over once again.<br/>

         Soon with Christ our Saviour we shall reign ;<br/>
         Ye ransomed of the Lord, try a soul to win ; <br/>
         Let us hear you tell it over ones again.<br/></p>
