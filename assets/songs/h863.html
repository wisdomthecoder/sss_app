<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>I looked to Jesus in my sin, <br/>
         My woe and want confessing ; <br/>
         Undone and lost I came to Him — <br/>
         I sought and found a blessing.  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         I looked . . to Him ;  . . <br/>
         'Tis true— His  Whosoever  ! <br/>
         He looked . . on me : . . <br/>
         And we were one for ever. </div>

         
         2 I looked to Jesus on the cross ; <br/>
         For me I saw Him dying ; <br/>
         God's word believed — that all my sins <br/>
         Were there upon Him lying. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 I looked to Jesus there on high, <br/>
         From death upraised to glory ; <br/>
         I trusted in His power to save, <br/>
         Believed the old, old story. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 He looked on me — oh, look of love ! <br/>
         <br/>
         My heart by it was broken ; <br/>
         And with that look of love He gave <br/>
         The Holy Spirit's token. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 Now one with Christ, I find my peace <br/>
         In Him to be abiding ; <br/>
         And in His love for all my need, <br/>
         In childlike faith confiding. <br/></p>
