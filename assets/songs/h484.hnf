
  1 I was a wandering sheep, 
            I did not love the fold ; 
            I did not love my Shepherd's voice, 
            I would not be controlled : 
            I was a wayward child, 
            I did not love my home, 
            I did not love my Father's voice, 
            I loved afar to roam. 
            
            2 The Shepherd sought His sheep, 
            The Father sought His child ; 
            They followed me o'er vale and hill, 
            O'er deserts waste and wild : 
            They found me nigh to death, 
            Famished, and faint, and lone ; 
            They bound me with the bands of love, 
            They saved the wandering one. 
            
            3 Jesus my Shepherd is, 
            'Twas He that loved my soul ; 
            'Twas He that washed me in His blood, 
            'Twas He that made me whole ; 
            'Twas He that sought the lost, 
            That found the wandering sheep ; 
            â€˜Twas He that brought me to the fold, 
            'Tis He that still doth keep. 
            
            4 I was a wandering sheep, 
            I would not be controlled ; 
            But now I love my Saviour's voice, 
            I love, I love the fold. 
            I was a wayward child, 
            I once preferred to roam ; 
            But now I love my Father's voice---- 
            I love, I love His home.
