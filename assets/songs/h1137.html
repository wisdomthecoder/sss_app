<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Far above in highest heaven <br/>
         Jesus reigns, our Lord and King; <br/>
         He His life for us has given, <br/>
         He did life eternal bring : <br/>
         Sing, then, children, sing with gladness, <br/>
         Loud let grateful anthems ring; <br/>
         Jesus is the children's Saviour, <br/>
         Jesus is the children's King. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 Once on earth the children praised Him, <br/>
         And  Hosanna  was their cry ; <br/>
         Now that God to heaven has raised Him, <br/>
         Loud they praise Him in the sky: <br/>
         Shout, then, children, shout your praises, <br/>
         Loud let grateful anthems ring; <br/>
         Jesus is the children's Saviour, <br/>
         Jesus is the children's King. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Come, then, early, come to Jesus, <br/>
         As the children did of old: <br/>
         He from sin and sorrow frees us, <br/>
         Never will His love grow cold : <br/>
         Daily let us learn to love Him, <br/>
         Daily let us join to sing <br/>
         Praises to our Lord and Saviour, <br/>
         <br/>
         Praises to the children's King. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Then, when life's short days are ended, <br/>
         If we've served our Saviour well, <br/>
         By His angels gently tended, <br/>
         In His kingdom we shall dwell : <br/>
         There we'll shout our joyous praises, <br/>
         There the song of victory sing ; <br/>
         Jesus is our Lord and Saviour, <br/>
         Jesus is the children's King. <br/></p>
