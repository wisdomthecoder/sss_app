<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand of his lords, <br/>
            While they drank from golden vessels, <br/>
            as the Book of Truth records : <br/>
            In the night, as they revelled in the <br/>
            royal palace hall, <br/>
            They were seized with consternation <br/>
            -----'twas the Hand upon the wall ! 
            
            <div class="chorus">
            ‘Tis the hand of God on the wall ! . . . <br/>
            'Tis the hand of God on the wall  . . . <br/>
            Shall the record be---- Found wanting !  <br/>
            Or shall it be---- “Found trusting !  <br/>
            While that hand is writing on the wall ? . . . </div>

            2 See the brave captive, Daniel, as he <br/>
            stood before the throng, <br/>
            And rebuked the haughty monarch <br/>
            for his mighty deeds of wrong ; <br/>
            As he read out the writing-----'twas the <br/>
            doom of one and all, <br/>
            For the kingdom now was finished----<br/>
            said the Hand upon the wall ! <br/>
            <br/>
            3 See the faith, zeal, and courage, that <br/>
            would dare to do the right, <br/>
            Which the Spirit gave to Daniel----<br/>
            'twas the secret of his might ; <br/>
            In his home in Judea, or a captive in <br/>
            the hall, [upon the wall ! <br/>
            He understood the writing of his God <br/>
            <br/>
            4 So our deeds are recorded-----there's a <br/>
            Hand that's writing now : <br/>
            Sinner, give your heart to Jesus---- to <br/>
            His royal mandate bow ; <br/>
            For the day is approaching â€” it must <br/>
            come to one and all, <br/>
            When the sinner's condemnation will <br/>
            be written on the wall ! <br/></p>
