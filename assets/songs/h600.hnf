
  1 Search me, O Lord ! and try this heart of mine ;
         Search me, and prove if I indeed am Thine : 
         Test by Thy word, that never changed can be, 
         My strength of hope and living faith in Thee.
         
         2 Search me, O Lord ! subdue each vain desire,
         And in my soul a deeper love inspire; 
         Hide Thou my life, that I, supremely blest, 
         Beneath Thy wings in perfect peace may rest.
         
         3 Search me, O Lord ! and from the dross of sin,  
         Refine as gold, and keep me pure within ;
         Search Thou my thoughts, whose 
         springs Thine eyes can see : 
         From secret faults, O Saviour, cleanse; 
         Thou me ! 
         
         4 Search me, O Lord ! let faith throâ€™ 
         grace divine 
         Thyself reflect in every act of mine, 
         Till at Thy call my waiting soul shall rise, 
         Caught up with joy to meet Thee in the skies.
