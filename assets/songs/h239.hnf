
  1 In the cross of Christ I glory, 
            Towering o'er the wrecks of time ; 
            All the light of sacred story 
            Gathers round its head sublime. 
            
            2 When the woes of life o'ertake me, 
            Hopes deceive, and fears annoy, 
            Never shall the cross forsake me ; 
            Lo ! it glows with peace and joy. 
            
            3 When the sun of bliss is beaming 
            Light and love upon my way, 
            From the cross the radiance streaming 
            Adds new lustre to the day. 
            
            4 Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure, 
            By the cross are sanctified ; 
            Peace is there that knows no 
            measure, 
            Joys that through all time abide.
