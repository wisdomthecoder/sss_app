  <p>1 In many a little village, in many a city great, <br/>
         The rich men, and the noble, and men of poor estate,<br/>
         Are entering this morning the Father's <br/>
         house of prayer — <br/>
         And wheresoe'er they seek Him, we <br/>
         know that He is there. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 And we, His little children, are gathered <br/>
         here to-day ; <br/>
         Our schoolroom is the temple in which <br/>
         we meet to pray : [of God — <br/>
         It is the gate of heaven, it is the house <br/>
         For He Himself is present, according to <br/>
         His word. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Lord, make us really sorry as we our sins confess,  <br/>
         And may we feel Thee near us, to pardon and to bless : <br/>
         O purify, dear Saviour, our naughty hearts to-day,  <br/>
         That gladly we may praise Thee, and humbly we may pray !<br/>
         <br/>
         4 And when Thy servant speaketh the <br/>
         word that Thou hast given, <br/>
         May we receive it gladly — a message sent <br/>
         from heaven: <br/>
         And as we humbly listen, do Thou to each heart speak<br/>
         A word to bring us gladness throughout <br/>
         the coming week. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 Here may we learn to please Thee in <br/>
         work-time and at play — <br/>
         To seek Thee and to serve Thee, to love <br/>
         Thy holy day: <br/>
         Thus bless our children's service, and fill us with Thy grace,<br/>
         And make each heart Thy temple, Thy <br/>
         earthly dwelling-place. <br/></p>
