  <p>1 How honoured, how dear, that sacred abode, <br/>
            Where Christians draw near their Father and God I<br/>
            'Mid worldly commotion, my wearied <br/>
            soul faints <br/>
            For the house of devotion, the home of Thy saints<br/>
            <br/>
            2 The birds have their home, they fix <br/>
            on their nest ; <br/>
            Wherever they roam, they turn to their rest : <br/>
            From them fondly learning, my soul <br/>
            would take wing ; <br/>
            To Thee so returning, my God and my King.<br/>
            <br/>
            3 O happy the choirs who praise Thee <br/>
            above !  <br/>
            What joy tunes their lyres ! their worship is love.<br/>
            Yet safe in Thy keeping and happy they be <br/>
            In this world of weeping, whose strength is in Thee. <br/>
            <br/>
            4 Though rugged their way, they drink, as they go, <br/>
            Of springs that convey new life as they flow :<br/>
            The God they rely on, their strength <br/>
            shall renew, <br/>
            Till each, brought to Zion, His glory shall view.<br/>
            <br/>
            5 Thou Hearer of prayer, still grant me <br/>
            a place [courts of Thy grace : <br/>
            Where Christians repair to the <br/>
            More blest, beyond measure, one day <br/>
            so employed, [lings enjoyed. <br/>
            Than years of vain pleasure by world- <br/>
            <br/>
            6 The Lord is a Sun, the Lord is a Shield; <br/>
            What grace has begun, with glory is sealed.<br/>
            He hears the distressed, He succours the just :  <br/>
            And they shall be blessed who make Him their trust.<br/></p>
