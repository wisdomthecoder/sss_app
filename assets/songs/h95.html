<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 He hath spoken, Be still, the Rebuker of seas<br/>
    The command was for me, and my heart is at ease ; <br/>
    He hath hushed into silence the waves <br/>
    and the winds, [my sins. <br/>
    By applying His blood and removing <br/>
    He's the Prince of Peacemakers, all glory to God,

    <div class="chorus"> 
    To redeem me, and cleanse me, He shed His own blood ;  <br/>
    My adoption is sealed, I'm a child of the King, <br/>
    And for ever and ever of Jesus I'll sing. </div>
    
    2 He hath quickened my soul by a life <br/>
    from above ; [is love, <br/>
    It was done by the Spirit, its essence <br/>
    He hath pardoned and washed me as white as the snow, <br/>
    And my heart with His love does this moment overflow. <br/>
    <br/>
    3 He's a wonderful Jesus, this Saviour of mine ; <br/>
    He's the great Son of God â€” a Redeemer Divine ; <br/>
    He's my Strength and my Wisdom, <br/>
    my Life and my Lord, <br/>
    And enthroned in my heart to be loved and adored. <br/>
    <br/>
    4 I will love Him, and serve Him from now till I die ; <br/>
    For His love fills my heart, and His beauty my eye, <br/>
    He's the fairest and dearest of all to my soul,<br/>
    And our lives shall be one, while eternities roll.</p>
