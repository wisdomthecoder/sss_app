<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 When our ships have crossed the ocean, <br/>
         and been all around the world, <br/>
         When they safely gain the haven, and their sails again are furled ; <br/>
         We rejoice to see them enter, and to know the anchor's cast, <br/>
         Raising joyful shouts of welcome, for our ships are home at last.  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         Oh what singing, oh what shouting, when our <br/>
         ships come sailing home ! <br/>
         They have stood the mighty tempests, they <br/>
         have crossed the ocean's foam ; <br/>
         They have passed o'er stormy billows, but <br/>
         they now have gained the shore : <br/>
         The anchor's cast, they're home at last, the voyage is safely o'er. </div>

         
         2 But if there is such rejoicing to see vessels here get home, <br/>
         When we know that in a little while these ships again will roam â€” <br/>
         Oh, what must it be in heaven when a soul comes sailing in, <br/>
         To go out no more for ever sailing on the sea of sin ? <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Oh, methinks I hear the angels shout,  Here comes an earthly bark, <br/>
         She has found her way to heaven, tho' the way was rough and dark : <br/>
         But she had a star to guide her called the Bright and Morning Star, <br/>
         It has guided millions over from that distant land afar. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 So with Jesus as our Captain we expect to gain that shore ; <br/>
         We expect to cast our anchor there, and stay for evermore ; <br/>
         And we know the angels will be there to greet us when we come, <br/>
         They will join in songs of rapture, <br/>
         Welcome home, oh, welcome home !  <br/></p>
