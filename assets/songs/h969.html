<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 'Tis a goodly pleasant land that we pilgrims journey through, <br/>
         And our Father's constant blessings fall around us like the dew ; <br/>
         But its sunshine and its beauty to our hearts no joy can bring, <br/>
         Like the splendours that await us in the palace of the King <br/>
         Oh, the palace of the King ! royal palace of the King !  
            
        <div class="chorus">
         Where our Father in His mercy all the ransomed ones will bring ; <br/>
         Where our sorrows and our trials like a dream will pass away,  <br/>
         And our souls shall dwell for ever in the realms of endless day.</div>

         
         2 Our Redeemer is the King; what a sacrifice He made, <br/>
         When He purchased our redemption, and His blood the ransom paid ! <br/>
         In His cross shall be our glory; to that blessed cross we'll cling, <br/>
         Till we reach the gates that open to the palace of the King. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 In this goodly pleasant land only strangers now are we, <br/>
         For we seek a better country, and 'tis there we long to be ; <br/>
         Yes, we long to swell the anthem that for evermore shall ring, <br/>
         From the pure in heart made perfect, in the palace of the King. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 We shall see Him by and by; Hallelujah to His name ! <br/>
         Through the blood of His atonement life eternal we may claim ; <br/>
         We shall cast our crowns before Him, and our songs of victory sing, <br/>
         When we enter in triumphant to the palace of the King. <br/></p>
