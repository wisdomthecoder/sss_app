
  1 Saviour ! Thy dying love 
         Thou gavest me, 
         Nor should I aught withhold, 
         My Lord, from Thee ; 
         In love my soul would bow, 
         My heart fulfil its vow, 
         Some offering bring Thee now, 
         Something for Thee. 
         
         2 At the blest mercy-seat, 
         Pleading for me, 
         My feeb'e faith looks up, 
         Jesus, to Thee : 
         Help me the cross to bear, 
         Thy wondrous lcve declare, 
         Some song to raise, or prayer, 
         Something for Thee. 
         
         3 Give me a faithful heart----
         Likeness to Thee,----
         That each departing day 
         Henceforth may see 
         Some work of love begun, 
         Some deed of kindness done, 
         Some wanderer sought and won, 
         Something for Thee. 
         
         4 All that I am and have----
         Thy gifts so free--- 
         In joy, in grief, through life, 
         O Lord, for Thee ! 
         And when Thy face I see, 
         My ransomed soul shall be, 
         Through all eternity, 
         Something for Thee.
