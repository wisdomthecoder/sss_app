  <p>1 Oh, for a song, a fair new song, <br/>
         Of praise, and joy, and love ! <br/>
         To reach the hearts of earth's sad throng,<br/>
         And lift to heaven above —  <br/>
         Of praise like the praise that the angels bring ; <br/>
         Of joy like the joy of the birds : <br/>
         Of the love in our hearts for the <br/>
         Christ our King — <br/>
         Love ever too deep for words. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 Oh, for a song, a fair new song, <br/>
         That ne'er was sung before ! <br/>
         To sing to Him to whom belong <br/>
         Our praises evermore — <br/>
         A song like the echo from harps above,  <br/>
         Dropped down from the city of gold ;<br/>
         Yea, a song of the joy, and the praise, and love, <br/>
         That ne'er hath been sung or told. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Oh, who shall sing this fair new song, <br/>
         Or make its chords complete — <br/>
         All notes of love, in souls that throng, <br/>
         And place before His feet. <br/>
         All fadeless the flowers in His path- <br/>
         way strewn, <br/>
         The pathway of Jesus our King ? <br/>
         Help us, Lord ! for alas, sadly out of tune  <br/>
         Are the hearts which the song would sing. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Oh, help us, Lord ! who knowest all ! <br/>
         We cannot sing or speak ; <br/>
         The clearest notes our lips let fall <br/>
         Seem e'er too cold and weak : <br/>
         Though sweet are the strains which <br/>
         our songs have rung <br/>
         From earth to the city of gold, <br/>
         Yet His fulness of glory we never have sung— <br/>
         The half ne'er hath yet been told. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 Such songs as angels ne'er can bring, <br/>
         The joy more pure than birds ; <br/>
         The love we bear for Christ our <br/>
         'Tis far too deep for words. [King- <br/>
         Be still, heart of mine ! we must wait a while, <br/>
         Thy God will attune thee ere long ; <br/>
         Then in heaven thou shalt sing in the <br/>
         Master's smile <br/>
         For ever the fair new song ! <br/></p>
