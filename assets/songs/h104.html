  <p>1 I've found a friend in Jesus,— He's everything to me;<br/>
            He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul !<br/>
            The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see— <br/>
            All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole;<br/>
            In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay;<br/>
            He tells me every care on Him to roll:<br/>
            He's theLily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star;<br/>
            He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul !

    <div class="chorus"> 
            In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay;<br/>
            He tells me every care on Him to roll:<br/>
            He's the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star; <br/>
            He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul !</div>
    
            2 He all my grief has taken, and all my sorrows borne;<br/>
            In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower;<br/>
            I've all for Him forsaken, I've all my idols torn<br/>
            From my heart—and now He keeps me by His power.<br/>
            Though all the world forsake me, and<br/>
            Satan tempt me sore,<br/>
            Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal.<br/>
            He's the Lily of the Valley, the<br/>
            Bright and Morning Star;<br/>
            He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul !<br/>
            <br/>
            3 He'll never, never leave me nor yet<br/>
            forsake me here, <br/>
            While I live by faith, and do His blessed will;<br/>
            A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear: <br/>
            With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.<br/>
            When crowned at last in glory, I'll<br/>
            see His blessed face, <br/>
            Where rivers of delight shall ever roll.<br/>
            His Names and Titles<br/>
            He's theLily of the Valley, the<br/>
            Bright and Morning Star;<br/>
            He's the fairest of ten thousand to<br/>
            my soul !<br/></p>
