<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 The cross that He gave may be heavy, <br/>
         But it ne'er outweighs His grace : <br/>
         The storm that I feared may surround me, <br/>
         But it ne'er excludes His face, 
            
            <div class="chorus">
         The cross is not greater than His grace, <br/>
         The storm cannot hide His blessed face <br/>
         I am satisfied to know <br/>
         That with Jesus here below, <br/>
         I can conquer every foe. </div>

         
         2 The thorns in my path are not sharper <br/>
         Than composed His crown for me : <br/>
         The cup that I drink not more bitter <br/>
         Than He drank in Gethsemane. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 The light of His love shineth brighter, <br/>
         As it falls on paths of woe : <br/>
         The toil of my work groweth lighter, <br/>
         As I stoop to raise the low. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 His will I have joy in fulfilling, <br/>
         As I'm walking in His sight : <br/>
         My all to the blood I am bringing, <br/>
         It alone can keep me right. <br/></p>
