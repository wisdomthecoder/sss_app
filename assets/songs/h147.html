  <p>1 The Lord of glory ! who is He ?<br/>
            Who is the King of glory ?<br/>
            Only the Son of God can be<br/>
            The Christ, the King of glory :<br/>
            Consider all His wounds, and see<br/>
            How Jesus' death upon the tree<br/>
            Proclaims Him King of glory.

            2 Above all heavens, at God's right hand,<br/>
            Now sits the King of glory;<br/>
            The angels by His favour stand<br/>
            Before the throne of glory:<br/>
            Swiftly they fly at His command,<br/>
            To guard His own of every land.<br/>
            To keep the heirs of glory.<br/>
            <br/>
            3 Death and the grave confess the Lamb<br/>
            To be the King of glory; <br/>
            The powers of darkness dread His name,<br/>
            All creatures show His glory:<br/>
            He said, Ere Abraham was I AMâ€”<br/>
            Jesus is evermore the same,<br/>
            Th' Almighty King of glory.<br/>
            <br/>
            4 Thrice happy who in Him believe,<br/>
            They soon will share His glory;<br/>
            Born of His Spirit, they receive<br/>
            His secret pledge of glory : <br/>
            Taught by His cross, for sin they grieve;<br/>
            He calls them brethren, and they cleave<br/>
            To Him, their hope of glory, <br/></p>
