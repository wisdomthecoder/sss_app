  <p>1 Watch, earnestly watch, the Lord's approach is nearing ; <br/>
            Pray, fervently pray, no man can know the hour ; <br/>
            Like as a thief at night is His appearing ; <br/>
            He cometh to judge the world in truth and power.
            
            <div class="chorus">
            Watch ye, pray ye, soldiers of the Lord ; <br/>
            Work ye, wait ye, trusting in His word ; <br/>
            Keep His commandments ? and His law obey, <br/>
            And He will reward you in the last great day. 
          </div>
          
            2 Work, joyfully work, all ye who know <br/>
            His chastening;  <br/>
            Wait, patiently wait, for your reward is nigh;<br/>
            Lift up your heads, the day of rest is hastening ; <br/>
            Rest, glorious rest, with Jesus by and by.<br/>
            <br/>
            3 Trust, loyally trust, and as to Him <br/>
            thou'rt clinging, <br/>
            Keep, faithfully keep the Saviour's <br/>
            blest commands ; <br/>
            Then in thy heart the blest assurance <br/>
            ringing, <br/>
            Know surely thy name is written in His hands.<br/></p>
