  <p>1 Sinner, how thy heart is troubled ! <br />
    God is coming very near ; <br />
    Do not hide thy deep emotion, <br />
    Do not check that failing tear.

  <div class="chorus">
    Oh, be saved, His grace is free ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee !
  </div>
  
  2 Jesus now is bending o'er thee, <br />
  Jesus lowly, meek, and mild : <br />
  To the Friend who died to save thee, <br />
  Wilt thou not be reconciled ?
  <div class="chorus">
    <br />
    Oh, be saved, His grace is free ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee !<br />
  </div>
  3 Art thou waiting till the morrow ? <br />
  Thou may'st never see its light ; <br />
  Come at once ! accept His mercy : <br />
  He is waiting----- come to-night ! <br>
  <div class="chorus">
    <br />
    Oh, be saved, His grace is free ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee !<br />
  </div>
  4 With a lowly, contrite spirit, <br />
  Kneeling at the Saviour's feet, <br />
  Thou canst feel, this very moment, <br />
  Pardon--- precious, pure, and sweet !
  <div class="chorus">
    <br />
    Oh, be saved, His grace is free ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee !<br />
  </div>
  5 Let the angels bear the tidings <br />
  Upward to the courts of heaven ! <br />
  Let them sing, with holy rapture, <br />
  O'er another soul forgiven !
  <div class="chorus">
    <br />
    Oh, be saved, His grace is free ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee ! <br />
    Oh, be saved, He died for thee !<br />
