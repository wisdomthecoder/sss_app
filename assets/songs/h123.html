  <p>1 There is life for a look at the Crucified One, <br/>
            There is life at this moment for thee;<br/>
            Then, look, sinner, look unto Him<br/>
            and be saved, .<br/>
            Unto Him who was nailed to the tree

    <div class="chorus"> 
            Look ! look ! look and live !<br/>
            There is life for a look at the Crucified One,<br/>
            There is life at this moment for thee.</div>
    
            2 Oh, why was He there as the Bearer<br/>
            of sin,<br/>
            If on Jesus thy guilt was not laid ?<br/>
            Oh, why from His side flowed the<br/>
            sin-cleansing blood,<br/>
            If His dying thy debt has not paid ?<br/>
            <br/>
            3 It is not thy tears of repentance or prayers, <br/>
            But the Blood, that atones for the soul;<br/>
            On Him, then, who shed it, thou mayest at once<br/>
            Thy weight of iniquities roll.<br/>
            His Humiliation, Resurrection, and Glory<br/>
            <br/>
            4 Then doubt not thy welcome, since<br/>
            God has declared <br/>
            There remaineth no more to be done;<br/>
            That once in the end of the world<br/>
            He appeared, [begun.<br/>
            And completed the work He<br/>
            <br/>
            5 Then take with rejoicing from Jesus at once<br/>
            The life everlasting He gives;<br/>
            And know with assurance thou never canst die,.<br/>
            Since Jesus, thy Righteousness, lives</p>
