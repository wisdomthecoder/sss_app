<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 I think when I read that sweet story of old, <br />
    When Jesus was here among men, <br />
    How He called little children as lambs <br />
    to His fold <br />
    I should like to have been with them



  <div class="chorus">
    I should like to have been with them <br />
    I should like to have been with them <br />
    How He called little children as lambs to His fold,<br />
    I should like to have been with them then.</div>


  2 I wish that His hands had been placed <br />
  on my head, <br />
  That His arms had been thrown around me<br />
  And that I might have seen His kind <br />
  look when He said, <br />
  Let the little ones come unto Me. <br />
  <br />

  3 Yet still to His footstool in prayer I may go,<br />
  And ask for a share in His love ; <br />
  And if I now earnesly seek Him below, <br />
  I shall see Him and hear Him above, <br />

  4 In that beautiful place He is gone to prepare, <br />
  For all who are washed and forgiven ; <br />
  And many dear children are gathering there, <br />
  For of such is the kingdom of heaven. <br />
  <br />
