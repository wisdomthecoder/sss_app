<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Loved with everlasting love, <br/>
         Led by grace that love to know ; <br/>
         Spirit, breathing from above, <br/>
         Thou hast taught me it is so ! <br/>
         Oh this full and perfect peace ! <br/>
         Oh this transport all divine ! <br/>
         In a love which cannot cease, <br/>
         I am His, and He is mine ; <br/>
         In a love which cannot cease, <br/>
         I am His, and He is mine. <br/>
         <br/>
         2 Heaven above is softer blue, <br/>
         Earth around is sweeter green ! <br/>
         Something lives in every hue <br/>
         Christless eyes have never seen : <br/>
         Birds with gladder songs o'erflow, <br/>
         Flowers with deeper beauties shine, <br/>
         Since I know, as now I know, <br/>
         I am His, and He is mine. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Things that once were wild alarms <br/>
         Cannot now disturb my rest ; <br/>
         Closed in everlasting arms, <br/>
         Pillowed on the loving breast. <br/>
         Oh to lie for ever here, <br/>
         Doubt and care and self resign, <br/>
         While He whispers in my ear â€” <br/>
         I am His, and He is mine ! <br/>
         <br/>
         4 His for ever, only His ; <br/>
         Who the Lord and me shall part ! <br/>
         Ah, with what a rest of bliss <br/>
         Christ can fill the loving heart ! <br/>
         Heaven and earth may fade and flee, <br/>
         First-born light in gloom decline ; <br/>
         But, while God and I shall be, <br/>
         I am His and He is mine. <br/></p>
