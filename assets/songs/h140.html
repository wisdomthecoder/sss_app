  <p>1 All ye that pass by,<br/>
            To Jesus draw nigh;<br/>
            To you is it nothing<br/>
            That Jesus should die ?<br/>
            Your ransom and peace,<br/>
            Your surety He is,<br/>
            Come, see if there ever<br/>
            Was sorrow like His.<br/>
            <br/>
            2 For what you have done<br/>
            His blood must atone:<br/>
            The Father hath punished<br/>
            For you His dear Son:<br/>
            The Lord, in the day<br/>
            Of His anger did lay<br/>
            Your sins on the Lamb,<br/>
            And He bore them away.<br/>
            <br/>
            3 He died to atone<br/>
            For sins not His own;<br/>
            Your debt He hath paid<br/>
            And your work He hath done:<br/>
            Ye all may receive<br/>
            The peace He did leave,<br/>
            Who made intercession,<br/>
            My Father, forgive !<br/>
            4 For you and for me<br/>
            He prayed on the tree;<br/>
            The prayer is accepted,<br/>
            The sinner is free;<br/>
            The sinner am I,<br/>
            Who on Jesus rely,<br/>
            And come for the pardon<br/>
            God cannot deny.<br/>
            <br/>
            5 His death is my plea;<br/>
            My Advocate see,<br/>
            And hear the blood speak<br/>
            That hath answered for me:<br/>
            He purchased the grace<br/>
            Which now I embrace;<br/>
            O Father, Thou know'st<br/>
            He hath died in my place !<br/></p>
