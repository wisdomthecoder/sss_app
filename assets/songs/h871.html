  <p>1 I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend ! <br/>
         He loved me ere I knew Him ; <br/>
         He drew me with the cords of love, <br/>
         And thus He bound me to Him. <br/>
         And round my heart still closely twine <br/>
         Those ties which naught can sever, <br/>
         For I am His and He is mine, <br/>
         For ever and for ever ! <br/>
         <br/>
         2 I've found a Friend ; oh, such a Friend ! <br/>
         He bled, He died to save me ; <br/>
         And not alone the gift of life, <br/>
         But His own self He gave me ; <br/>
         Naught that I have my own I call, <br/>
         I hold it for the Giver : [all, <br/>
         My heart, my strength, my life, my <br/>
         Are His, and His for ever! <br/>
         <br/>
         3 I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend ! <br/>
         All power to Him is given, <br/>
         To guard me on my onward course, <br/>
         And bring me safe to heaven. <br/>
         Th' eternal glories gleam afar, <br/>
         To nerve my faith endeavour : <br/>
         So now to watch ! to work ! to war ! <br/>
         And then â€” to rest for ever ! <br/>
         <br/>
         4 I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend ! <br/>
         So kind, and true, and tender, <br/>
         So wise a Counsellor and Guide, <br/>
         So mighty a Defender ! <br/>
         From Him, who loves me now so well, <br/>
         What power my soul can sever ? <br/>
         Shall life ? or death ? or earth ? or hell ? <br/>
         No ! I am His for ever ! </p>
