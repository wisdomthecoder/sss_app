<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Praise the Lord and worship Him, a song prepare,<br/>
            While we enter joyfully the house of prayer; <br/>
            Praise the Lord and honour Him who guards our way, <br/>
            Watching o'er us tenderly by night and day.
            
            <div class="chorus">
            Praise Him ! praise Him ! join the loud acclaim ;<br/>
            Praise Him ! praise Him ! bless His holy name ; <br/>
            Ever kind and merciful in all His ways, <br/>
            He alone is worthy to receive our praise. 
          </div>
          
            2 Praise Him in His majesty and <br/>
            strength arrayed ;<br/>
            Praise Him in the firmament His hands have made ; <br/>
            In our lives acknowledge Him the <br/>
            King of kings, <br/>
            Then in safety we may dwell beneath His wings,<br/>
            <br/>
            3 Praise Him in His righteousness, the <br/>
            Holy One ; <br/>
            Spread abroad the wondrous work that He hath done ; <br/>
            Through His perfect sacrifice the <br/>
            world is blest,<br/>
            Whosoever will, may come to Him and rest.</p>
