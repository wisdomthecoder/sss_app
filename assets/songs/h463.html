  <p>1 Afflictions, though they seem severe, <br/>
            In mercy oft are sent ; <br/>
            They stopped the prodigal's career, <br/>
            And caused him to repent. 
            
            <div class="chorus">
            I'll not pine here for bread, <br/>
            I'll not pine here for bread, he cries ; <br/>
            Nor starve in foreign lands : <br/>
            My father's house has large supplies, <br/>
            And bounteous are his hands. </div>

            2  What have I gained by sin, he said, <br/>
            But hunger, shame, and fear ? <br/>
            My father's house abounds in bread, <br/>
            While I am starving here !  <br/>
            <br/>
            3  I'll go and tell him all I've done, <br/>
            Fall down before his face ; <br/>
            Unworthy to be called his son, <br/>
            I'll seek a servant's place. <br/>
            <br/>
            4 His father saw him coming back ; <br/>
            He saw, he ran, he smiled, <br/>
            And threw his arms around the neck <br/>
            Of his rebellious child ! <br/>
            <br/>
            5  O father, I have sinned-----forgive !  <br/>
            â€œEnough !  the father said : <br/>
            Rejoice, my house ; my son's alive, <br/>
            For whom I mourned as dead !  <br/>
            <br/>
            6 'Tis thus the Lord His love reveals, <br/>
            To call poor sinners home ; <br/>
            More than a father's love He feels, <br/>
            And welcomes all that come. </p>
