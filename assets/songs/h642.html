<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 When we walk with the Lord <br/>
         In the light of His Word, <br/>
         What a glory He sheds on our way ! <br/>
         While we do His good will. <br/>
         He abides with us still, <br/>
         And with all who will trust and obey. 
            
            <div class="chorus">
         Trust and obey, for there's no other way <br/>
         To be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey. </div>

         
         2 Not a shadow can rise <br/>
         Not a cloud in the skies, <br/>
         But His smile quickly drives it away ; <br/>
         Not a doubt nor a fear, <br/>
         Not a sigh nor a tear, <br/>
         Can abide while we trust and obey. <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Not a burden we bear, <br/>
         Not a sorrow we share, <br/>
         But our toil He doth richly repay ; <br/>
         Not a grief nor a loss, <br/>
         Not a frown nor a cross, <br/>
         But is blest if we trust and obey. <br/>
         <br/>
         4 But we never can prove <br/>
         The delights of His love, <br/>
         Until all on the altar we lay ; <br/>
         For the favour He shows, <br/>
         And the joy He bestows, <br/>
         Are for them who will trust and obey. <br/>
         <br/>
         5 Then in fellowship sweet <br/>
         We will sit at His feet, <br/>
         Or we'll walk by His side in the way ; <br/>
         What He says we will do, <br/>
         Where He sends we will go, <br/>
         Never fear, only trust and obey. </p>
