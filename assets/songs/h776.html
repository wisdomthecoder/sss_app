<div class="w3-container m1">
  <p>1 Where is my wandering boy tonight-----<br/>
         The boy of my tenderest care, <br/>
         The boy that was once my joy and light, <br/>
         The child of my love and prayer ?  
            
            <div class="chorus">
         Oh, where is my boy to-night ? <br/>
         Oh, where is my boy to-night ? <br/>
         My heart o'erflows, for I love him he knows ! <br/>
         Oh, where is my boy to-night ? </div>

         
         2 Once he was pure as morning dew, <br/>
         As he knelt at his mother's knee; <br/>
         No face was so bright, no heart more <br/>
         And none was so sweet as he, [true, <br/>
         <br/>
         3 Oh, could I see you now, my boy, <br/>
         As fair as in olden time, [a joy, <br/>
         When prattle and smile made home <br/>
         And life was a merry chime ! <br/>
         <br/>
         4 Go for my wandering boy to-night; <br/>
         Go, search for him where you will ; <br/>
         But bring him to me with all his blight, <br/>
         And tell him I love him still ! <br/></p>
