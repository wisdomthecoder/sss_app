
  1 Holy Father ! hear my cry ; 
         Holy Saviour ! bend Thine ear ; 
         Holy Spirit ! come Thou nigh ;----
         Father, Saviour, Spirit, hear ! 
         
         2 Father, save me from my sin ; 
         Saviour, I Thy mercy crave ; 
         Gracious Spirit, make me clean;-----
         Father, Son, and Spirit, save ! 
         
         3 Father, let me taste Thy love ; 
         Saviour, fill my soul with peace ; 
         Spirit, come, my heart to move : 
         Father, Son, and Spirit bless ! 
         
         4 Father, Son, and Spirit, Thou 
         One Jehovah, shed abroad 
         All Thy grace within me now-----
         Be my Father and my God !
